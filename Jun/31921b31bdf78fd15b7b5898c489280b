ASX-listed African gold explorer Predictive Discovery has further strengthened its land position within Guinea’s Siguiri Basin. The company was granted an exploration permit over the Saman project, which was previously held through a reconnaissance authorisation. The new permit directly abuts Predictive’s Kaninko permit and may contain a possible northern extension to the northernmost mineralised power auger hole in the NE Bankan gold mineralised zone (16 m at 6.82 g/t gold).

Further power auger drilling on Saman is expected in the next week. In Guinea, reconnaissance authorisations are short-term tenements on which reconnaissance exploration activities (e.g. geochemical sampling and geological mapping etc) are permitted, while an exploration permit is a longer term holding (three-year initial term with two, two-year renewals for seven years in total). Advanced exploration activities (e.g. reverse circulation and diamond drilling) are permitted on exploration permits. In April, Predictive Discovery secured the right to acquire up to 100% of the highly mineralised Koundian property package located along strike from Managem’s 2 Moz Tri-K gold deposits, within Guinea’s prolific Siguiri Basin. The Siguiri Basin forms part of the richly mineralised West African Birimian gold belt and consists largely of meta-sediments with minor granitic rocks, metavolcanics and mafic to ultramafic intrusives.
