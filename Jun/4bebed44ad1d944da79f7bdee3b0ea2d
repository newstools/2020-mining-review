Gold prices this year have risen to their highest level since 2012 amid fears of a global Coronavirus-induced economic slowdown. What does this mean for Africa’s booming gold mining industry? While many gold mines have had to halt operations due to COVID-19 lockdowns and restrictions, which may have an effect on their short-term profitability, the future looks bright as gold prices are expected to continue to rise even as economies recover and mines return to full operation. This will allow Africa’s gold miners to take advantage of the high price environment. Join Mining Review Africa for a live panel discussion that will unpack the effects of the gold price rally on Africa.
