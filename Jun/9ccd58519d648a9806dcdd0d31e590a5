Anglo American Platinum announced on 3 June 2020 that a water leak had been detected in the high-pressure cooling section of the Anglo Converter Plant (ACP) Phase B unit. All employees were safely evacuated as a precaution. The Company took the decision to temporarily close the ACP Phase B unit to secure a safe operating environment, protect employees and protect the integrity of the plant. The detailed technical investigation into the cause of the water leak shows localised damage to a single cooler tube that is now being replaced and confirms that this leak is unconnected to the repair work recently completed on the ACP Phase B unit. Other maintenance is being carried out and additional controls put in place whilst the ACP Phase B unit is off-line in order to provide greater operational stability. The repair work is expected to be completed next week, and recommissioning will then start once a detailed risk-based assurance process has confirmed it is safe to do so. A prudent approach will be taken to safely ramp up the ACP Phase B unit. Increased monitoring will likely result in intermittent stoppages to inspect the plant until the repairs to the ACP Phase A unit are completed. The repairs to the ACP Phase A unit are progressing well and are now expected to complete towards the end of 2020 due to the successful accelerated procurement of key long-lead time items. Anglo American Platinum will continue to receive concentrate from third parties and joint ventures under the purchase of concentrate and toll agreements and will continue to deliver metal to customers.
