AIM-listed Armadale Capital is under NDA with two separate parties with respect to project finance initiatives ahead of construction for Phase 1 of its 80 000 tpa nameplate capacity Mahenge Liandu graphite project in Tanzania. These discussions follow the release of the results of its updated feasibility study delivered on 5 June 2020. The discussions are aimed at advancing project level funding with a view to bringing in an investment partner to progress through to mine construction at Mahenge Liandu. As part of specific workstreams running concurrent to the recently delivered definitive feasibility study, and in increasing intensity since its completion, Armadale and its technical and financial advisors have been engaging with a number of potential strategic investors or possible joint venture partners.

For Armadale, finalising an agreement with a potential strategic investor or joint venture partner will represent an extremely important milestone for Armadale and we are fully committed to advancing these discussions whilst also continuing to progress workstreams in relation to detailed design engineering, and the finalisation of the company’s application for a full mining licence,” says Johansen. He notes that Armadale has delivered a number of key value accretive milestones in recent months and the company looks forward to maintaining this momentum in the near term in order to continue to build value for its shareholders.
