ASX-listed Marenica Energy has re-commenced uranium exploration in Namibia following lifting of the COVID-19 lockdown restrictions. The company has commenced the first of two drilling programmes. The first drilling program is on exclusive prospecting license 7278 called Hirabeb. Hirabeb is highly prospective for uranium due to identification of extensive palaeochannels using horizontal loop electromagnetic (HLE) surveys. The HLEM identified palaeochannels over a distance of 18 km from east to west and the drilling programme will validate the location of the palaeochannels and test for mineralisation within those palaeochannels. Read: Marenica expands uranium footprint in Namibia Low cost but plenty of potential A second drilling programme will test for mineralisation in palaeochannels to the east of Koppies. Marenica has already identified large areas of mineralisation in the Koppies palaeochannel system and this drilling is anticipated to extend that mineralisation. This drilling program will test the extension of the Koppies palaeochannel up to 3.7 km into the adjoining tenement immediately to the east. Marenica MD, Murray Hill, commented: “The company is pleased to have resumed exploration activities in Namibia. We are keen to see the outcome of our first drilling programme at the previously undrilled Hirabeb tenement. “In addition, there is much anticipation around being able to identify extensions of the uranium mineralisation in palaeochannels to the east of Koppies. The drilling programmes are low cost but with the potential to provide significant results.”
