Owner and operator of the Kareevlei Diamond Mine in South Africa, BlueRock Diamonds, has announced the private sale of 2,400 carats at an average of USD290 per carat for a total of USD700,000. BlueRock Executive Chairman, Mike Houston, says: “This sale at a time when the traditional sales channels for diamonds remain closed and at a price which we estimate to be at current market value for that particular parcel of diamonds is an excellent result in a highly uncertain market. “The parcel sold did not contain any notable high value diamonds and therefore the price achieved is approximately 15% below what we would have expected to achieve for this parcel pre the Covid-19 pandemic. “At a sale price of an average of US$290 per carat, which we hope represents the bottom of the market, the Group is cash flow positive. Following receipt of the sale proceeds the Group’s cash balance will be c£1.1 million and there is a further £268,000 to be received in August 2020 from the Teichmann Group in accordance with the terms of the placing in February 2020. “This sale significantly reduces the risks of operating in the Covid-19 environment.  It remains our plan to sell our future production through Bonas-Couzyn N.V,in Antwerp as per our arrangement announced on 13 May 2020.
