Based on the appropriate mobilisation, construction activities are expected to begin in relation to the tailings storage facility (TSF) wall building and the retreatment project optimisation. Eastplats remains committed to the Government of South Africa’s direction to prevent the risk of spread of COVID-19 and therefore continues to update and monitor its risk assessments. The company has also adopted appropriate procedures, consistent with government directives, to maintain a safe workplace for its employees and the communities in which it operates. The company notes that because the effects of COVID-19 are changing and evolving, it cannot reasonably estimate at this time all the impacts of COVID-19 or if new or unexpected changes to the lockdown levels will be imposed by the Government of South Africa. As a result, these issues could have material adverse effects on the company’s business, liquidity and cashflows and the company will resultantly update its forecasts for the year including the timelines of the completion of the retreatment project optimisation project when there is less uncertainty. 2020 Targets While COVID-19 could have material effects on the company’s 2020 outlook and its ability to attain targets, the company has outlined the following targets, which also remain subject to capital availability: READ MORE: PGM scavenger circuit refurb pays off for Eastplats The company is also actively looking at opportunities for its other assets and properties and exploring options to utilise or monetise these assets.
