The Minerals Council South Africa has launched a campaign to address sexual and gender-based violence and harassment on South Africa’s mines and in mining and labour-sending communities. In the run up to International Women’s Day, which will be celebrated on 8 May, the Minerals Council’s campaign titled, “Stop abuse of women”, is aimed at both men and women and makes it very clear what is meant by abuse; and also spells out the potential consequences of abusive action.

already have policies and systems in place to address sexual harassment and
violence in the workplace, this campaign is designed to complement their work
and to provide new capacity and impetus throughout the industry regarding this
critical issue. Gender-based violence is a serious
challenge throughout South Africa and elsewhere in the world. The Minerals
Council recognises that our industry has a particular responsibility to address
it given the predominance of men in management and the rest of the workforce,
the increasing numbers of women entering the workforce, and the nature of our
workplaces, particularly underground facilities. The campaign is designed to provide
a range of resources to members to enable them to give greater prominence to
addressing the challenges faced by women in the industry. The campaign is being
led by Minerals Council CEO, Roger Baxter, board member Deshnee Naidoo, and
Occupational Health head Dr Thuthula Balfour. “We encourage all member companies, others in
the industry and residents of mining communities and labour sending areas to
take action against gender-based violence and abuse in their workplaces and
communities and, where they observe any such incidents, not to stand aside but
rather to report those incidents and take any other appropriate action, says
Minerals Council CEO Roger Baxter: Reporting mechanism to
be established The Minerals Council is investigating
setting up industry-level mechanisms for the safe reporting of incidents of
violence and harassment, as well as developing guidelines for management on
appropriate company policies, systems and workplace infrastructure designed to
ensure a safe and comfortable working environment for women. The Minerals Council will continue to engage with all stakeholders in the industry, primarily under the auspices of the MHSC, on how we can better address this issue in our mines, and in our society.
