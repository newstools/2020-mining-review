AIM-listed emerging phosphate explorer and developer Kropz says that the appeal hearing against Elandsfontein's valid integrated water use licence, which was due to reconvene on 16 March, has been postponed. The outcomes of the hearing, which is the outcome of a battle between the developers of the project and environmental activists, may determine whether Kropz keeps the water license it needs to develop the Elandsfontein project in South Africa’s Western Cape Province. The activists claim that the water license being used by the
operation, which has yet to begin production, was awarded improperly, while Kropz
is refuting the allegation that the license is illegal. The postponement has been ordered by the chairperson of the Tribunal as certain parties undergo routine self-quarantine under government guidelines for persons recently arrived from COVID-19 affected regions. The hearing, which was scheduled to take place over three days, will
therefore be delayed while the Tribunal reviews alternative dates and
arrangements. The appeal hearing by the
Water Tribunal, against Elandsfontein’s existing and valid integrated
water use licence was set to be heard by the Water Tribunal on 11 September
2019, however, at the appellant’s request, the hearing was postponed at only
started in December 2019. To allow the tribunal the appropriate opportunity to fully review
the matter, Kropz said it would not comment further on the official proceedings
until the tribunal has announced its decision. Pending the Tribunal's decision, there is no legal impediment to the continuation of the water use activities authorised in the integrated water-use licence.
