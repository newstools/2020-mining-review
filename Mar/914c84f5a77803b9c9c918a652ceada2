Sibanye-Stillwater
has refuted a social media hoax of a purported COVID-19 case at its Marikana
operation, stating that there have been no confirmed cases of the virus at its
operations. A screenshot of a breaking news story from a prominent South African news agency regarding a purported confirmed case of COVID-19 at its Marikana operation is currently circulating on social media platforms. The company confirmed that there are currently no confirmed cases of COVID-19 at any of its operations and has confirmed with the news agency that the story is FAKE.

employees and our communities is our primary concern and we have prepared and
implemented detailed measures to prevent infection among employees and restrict
the spread of the COVID-19 virus, in alignment with measures adopted by the
South African President, to manage the threat of the virus. “This a malicious and disingenuous hoax and could
potentially have far reaching and damaging consequences for the company, the
mining industry and the country. Sibanye-Stillwater views this in an extremely
serious light and will pursue legal action when the source of the hoax is
traced. “The relevant regulatory authorities have also been informed and will no doubt pursue their own course of action. Sibanye-Stillwater is always committed to open and transparent communication and urges stakeholders to question any information from sources other than official releases from the company, the Minerals Council or the South African regulatory authorities.”
