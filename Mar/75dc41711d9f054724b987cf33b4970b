ASX-listed Lucapa Diamond Company and its project Lulo partners have updated details on the search for the hard-rock sources of the high-value alluvial diamonds being mined at the Lulo diamond project in Angola. Following the highly-encouraging tributary sampling results set out in the ASX announcements of 19 February and 21 February 2020, the Project Lulo partners commenced a drilling program in the Canguige catchment area targeting five kimberlite pipes considered prospective to host diamonds, along with two additional priority anomalies. Once the existing priority kimberlites are drilled, kimberlite bulk samples from these five pipes will be excavated for processing to test for diamonds.

Significantly, the 45 diamonds included a good population of white diamonds - including rare Type IIa gems and top D-colours - and a light fancy yellow. These diamond recoveries confirmed the Canguige catchment area contains at least one diamond-bearing kimberlite pipe contributing to the alluvial diamonds eroded downstream into the Cacuilo River valley.
