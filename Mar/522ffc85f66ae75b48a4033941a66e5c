event, bringing together investors, analysts, mining executives, geologists,
students, and government officials. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau returned,
making him the first sitting prime minister to appear for two consecutive
years. “This is the must-attend event for anyone connected to the mineral and mining industry across the world, and marks my 33rd straight year,” says PDAC President Felix Lee. “The PDAC Convention’s significance is now widely recognized by all levels of government who look forward to using it as an opportunity for announcements—including Prime Minister Trudeau.” Programming focused on Capital Markets, Indigenous, Student and Early Career, Sustainability and Geoscience remain popular among attendees, as well as Short Courses and Presentation Rooms.
