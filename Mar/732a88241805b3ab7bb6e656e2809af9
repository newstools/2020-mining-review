Emissions configurations for all regions The new 6030 meets the strictest diesel emissions standards when equipped with a diesel oxidation catalyst emissions control system. In this configuration, the C27 engines meet U.S. EPA Tier 4 Final and EU Stage V emissions standards. The system does not use diesel exhaust fluid (DEF) and delivers low operating costs. The 6030 produces gross power of 1209 kW (1,620 hp) when configured for lowest emissions.
