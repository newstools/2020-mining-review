ASX-listed West African Resources poured first gold at its Sanbrado gold project in Burkina Faso on Wednesday 18 March 2020. Gold bars weighing 23.9 kg (768 troy oz) were poured during the maiden gold pour on site. Construction and commissioning activities are complete in all areas and the project has recently passed 3 million LTI-free hours worked. The process plant mill throughput is already meeting nameplate capacity. This follows the start of ore processing through the milling and CIL circuits at Sanbrado earlier this month. At the time of reporting 75 000 t grading at 1.5 g/t of gold had been processed through the Sanbrado plant, with indicative metallurgical recoveries over 90%.

that this milestone marks the beginning of a new phase in the company’s story –
its successful transition from an exploration company to a gold producer. Hyde
thanked the West African Resources’ owners’ team and all consultants,
contractors and other stakeholders for their hard work and support over the
last four years to bring Sanbrado from discovery into production. Open Pit Mining Open-pit mining has ramped up mining activities and
continues at both the M5 and M1 South pits, with double day/night shifts ongoing.
Currently there are 250 000 t of oxide ore on the ROM pad at an average grade
of 1.5 g/t gold, which is reconciling well with grade control models. Underground Mining Underground development continues to progress to schedule. The first development crosscut on the 2120 level (300 m below surface) has intercepted visible gold north of the mine plan. Some 1 200 t of underground ore has been mined and stockpiled ready for processing. Grade control drilling of the first panel on the 2120 level has intercept visible gold, assays are pending.
