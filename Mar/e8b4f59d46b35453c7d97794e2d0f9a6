Sasol previously announced it was reviewing a variety of actions to address the challenges created by the impact of COVID-19 and the recent decline in the oil and chemical prices. In the short term, Sasol needs to enhance cash flow and reposition the balance sheet on the assumption that there is a sustained low oil price until the end of financial year 2021. It
is important to reiterate that Sasol currently has available liquidity of approximately
US$2.5 billion with no significant debt maturities before May 2021 and it therefore
believes it is positioned to withstand recent market volatility in the short
term. Sasol believes it can maintain liquidity headroom in excess of US$1 billion over the next 12 - 18 months with a US$25 per barrel oil price before the benefits of hedging. Read more about investment Sasol
has now announced a comprehensive response strategy designed to mitigate the impact
of these macroeconomic factors. This includes a commitment to re-set the organisation
to be globally competitive in a sustained low oil price environment. The
global portfolio of our foundation business remains cash positive under prevailing
spot market conditions and an oil hedging programme has been put in place to
insulate the balance sheet from further financial pressure. A
package of measures is being undertaken that is intended to fundamentally
reposition the Company over the following 24 months: Fleetwood Grobler, Sasol CEO, states: “In this dynamic and challenging environment, it’s critical that we tighten control on what we can, acting both swiftly and decisively. "My management team and I are fully committed to delivering on the measures that we have announced. “Sasol has a strong underlying business and all efforts are being made to enhance EBITDA in a sustained low oil price environment. "Delivering sustainable, long-term shareholder value is our imperative and we have a clear plan to achieve that.”
