READ MORE: Theta Gold Mines: Reawakening a gold giant The mill, which was transported from Rustenburg, completed a six-day journey to the Theta project site in Pilgrimâ€™s Rest, Mpumalanga, where Theta Gold Mines is progressing towards the official start of construction and mining, which will bring back much needed jobs and income for the town, with the restart of the historic gold operation. The new
mill has been incorporated into the revised and optimised plant design and
offers the project flexibility to easily expand production up to 1.2 Mtpa
should the project grow. Meanwhile, the company announced at the start of March 2020 that it has begun the tender process based on a Lump Sum Turnkey (LSTK) contract for the first stage 600 000 tpa gold plant construction. The company expects to complete the plant build tenders by late Q2, 2020. In addition
to issuing the tender for the LSTK contract and taking receipt of the ball min
on site, during Q1, 2020, Theta Gold Mines completed the submission of the
environmental impact assessment for the Starter Theta Open-pit project (which
includes the amendment of MR83 from an underground to and open pit mining
method), and completed a draft mining contract. Theta Gold Mines, which has access to over 43 historical mines and prospect areas that can be accessed and explored, with over 6.7 Moz of historical gold production recorded, aims to build a solid product ion portfolio to over 150 000 ozpa primarily around shallow, open pit or adit-entry, shallow underground hard rock mining sources.
