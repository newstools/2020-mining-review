New legislation promulgated by the Department of Mineral Resources and Energy requires all mines to take steps to install proximity detection systems (PDS) on trackless mobile machinery to mitigate human and machine related incidents, both at surface and underground. The pressure is now on, given that Level 9 safety
standards must be in place by December 2020, failing to do so could mean severe action being
brought against responsible parties and mine owners. Join Mining Review Africa for a Webinar that will unpack the regulatory requirements and outline the measures to be put in place for effective collision management.
