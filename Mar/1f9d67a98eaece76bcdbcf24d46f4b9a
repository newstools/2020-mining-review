Barrick and its Senegalese partner held a 90% interest in the Massawa project. As part of the transaction, Barrick and its partner will receive an up-front payment valued at $380 million at the time of announcement, comprised of 20,718,273 Teranga common shares, a cash payment of approximately $300 million, and a contingent payment of up to $50 million which is based upon the average gold price for the three-year period immediately following closing.

Barrick president and chief executive Mark Bristow says Massawa is one of the largest unexploited gold deposits in West Africa and its legacy company Randgold Resources had developed this over a period of years to the point where its value could now be optimally realized for the benefit of all its stakeholders which includes the Senegal Government.

"Barrick will participate in the upside of the combined asset through the 11% interest it is acquiring in Teranga through this transaction,” he says.
