This is going to be an exciting year for Canyon Coal as we are on track to reach 15 million tons of run of mine coal production, which will elevate the group into the category of a major coal mining house. This is a significant milestone in our company history as an inclusive, growth-orientated entity. We are proud to have built this company to this level of growth.
