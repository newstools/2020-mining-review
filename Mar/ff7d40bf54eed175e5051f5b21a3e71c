South Africa is facing a double dilemma right now in terms of unemployment and skills. Firstly, it has one of the highest unemployment rates in the world, but secondly, it also ranks poorly in terms of skills. The net effect is that despite this high unemployment level, companies still battle to find skilled workers. In mid-February, Cabinet gave the Employment Equity Amendment Bill of 2020 the green light for submission to Parliament. This is a crucial bill that seeks to strengthen the Employment Equity Act 55 of 1998 (the Act) and support efforts to eradicate the legacies of apartheid discrimination, as well as inequality in the workplace. When it becomes law, most likely in mid-2020, it will bring far-reaching consequences to employers in terms of rights and obligations. Read more features and analysis From the perspective of inequality in the workplace, the Employment Equity Amendment Bill will bring in mandatory training of employees, meaning that companies will have to focus on their training and development. Additionally, the Amendment Bill also makes specific reference to the issuing of an Employment Equity Compliance certificate. In short, the bill places
an obligation on companies to train their own employees, and in addition,
restricts organisations that do not meet the requirements of the Employment
Equity Compliance certificate regulations from bidding for state tenders. In light of the difficulties that companies face in finding – and sometimes retaining - skilled workers, it is therefore vital for business to take skills development and training seriously, especially where pivotal training is concerned. ‘Pivotal training’ refers to learnership programmes that are professional, technical as well as academic, and which will result in occupational qualifications or part qualifications within the National Qualifications Framework (NQF). Pivotal training will allow for the
following: The implementation of pivotal training will also allow for increased B-BBEE points, in that the points available under skills development and bursary expenditure allow for 10 points (up from eight), while the combined target remains at six percent. The latest World Economic Forum (WEF) Global Competitiveness Report ranked the skills of the South African workforce at 101 out of 141 countries; in other words, within the bottom third of economies assessed. The ease of finding skilled employees also Organisations can achieve this by implementing or introducing the following: skills development, bursaries, learnerships or internships, or of course a combination of these. Other areas affected by the revisions to the Employment Equity Act of 1998 include learnership allowances and mandatory grants. The revised learnership allowances are set out in the table below. On mandatory grants, some confusion currently reigns with regards to percentages of mandatory grants and a Labour Appeal Court judgment of 16 October 2019. Our best practice advice here is to urge companies to engage with their relevant SETA, in order to properly advise the Employment Equity Committees on which the business will serve, prior to the submission of Annexure 2 Reports in April 2020. Turning to the issue of the requisite
compliance certificates, and as per Government Gazette No. 41922 of 21 September
2018, a certificate of compliance to the Employment Equity Act will be issued
to employers only if: Critically, no government contracts will be awarded
without a compliance certificate (as per Section 53 of Act 55 of 1998 and with reference
to the above). In conclusion, as the new decade slowly but steadily unfolds, it is clear that the country remains under the yoke of an ongoing economic crisis. Remedial steps and solutions are multi-layered and will take time. Nonetheless, we believe steadfastly in the power of education and training to uplift and empower individuals, which in turn translates, like ripples in the proverbial pond, into positive effects for the wider organisation in which the individual operates, and in turn the wider region and state.
