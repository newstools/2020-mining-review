AIM-listed explorer Oriole Resources reports that its joint venture partner, IAMGOLD Corporation has initiated its year three option to spend up to US$8 million to earn a 70% interest in the Senala project in Senegal. IAMGOLD’S
decision to commence its year three earn-in at Senala, follows the recent
successful application for a new licence at the project, providing security of
tenure for up to a further 10 years. Since signing the
option agreement in March 2018, IAMGOLD has focused on the
Madina Bafé prospect in the south of Senala, where best results to date include
9.6 m grading 16.08 g/t of gold from 15.10 m (MBDD-002), 15 m grading 6.10 g/t
of gold from 14 m and 8 m grading 2.56 g/t of gold from 76 m. Madina Bafé lies
within 10 km of the 2.5 Moz Boto gold project, where around US$30 million
of investment in infrastructure has recently been announced ahead of a
construction decision during H1-2020, and has the potential to be a satellite
deposit. In November 2019, IAMGOLD completed its 2019/20 work programme, with air core drilling at the Saroudia prospect, immediately north of Madina Bafé. A total of 3 158 m were drilled in 454 holes (200m x 50m spacing) to test possible extensions of the surface gold anomalism already defined by Oriole Resources, with a single sample taken in each hole at the saprolite interface. No additional trends were identified at Saroudia and so no further work is planned for this prospect. Read more about gold mining IAMGOLD has
confirmed that it will now move northwards to commence drilling at the Faré
prospect. Faré is the most
advanced prospect within the Senala licence and Oriole Resources believes it
has potential to host a standalone deposit. The company had previously completed
more than 10 000 m of reverse circulation and diamond drilling at Faré, delivering
best intersections of 96 m grading 1.51 g/t of gold and 7 m grading 86.39 g/t
of gold. Soil sampling at
Faré, carried out by Oriole Resources in 2016, identified a south-westward
extension of the Faré South gold anomaly (>30 ppb gold) by at least 750 m
and up to 600 m in width. An initial programme involving approximately 10 000 m
of air core drilling is planned to further define and confirm areas of anomalism.
A follow up reverse circulation drilling programme will be designed contingent
on results from the air core drilling. As a result of
the new licence, new permits (environmental, water and forestry) applications
are under way to enable commencement of the programme. Since signing the agreement in March 2018, IAMGOLD has spent a total of US$1.5 million. As per the terms of the option agreement, IAMGOLD must spend a further US$1 million during year three to keep the option in good standing.
