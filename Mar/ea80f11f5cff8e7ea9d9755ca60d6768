Considering the volatile and uncertain global economic and investment outlook, Orion has undertaken the following actions: Orion's key focus is the optimisation studies for the development of the Prieska Project. Following the completion of the Prieska Project BFS in June 2019, Orion has been progressing optimisation studies and preparations for mine construction.

Orion is targeting the completion of all technical and engineering work by early Q2 CY2020 in order to present and demonstrate the positive impact of the optimisation work. In parallel with the completion of BFS optimisation studies, Orion is also having exploratory discussions with parties, who have the potential to enhance project value through the introduction of a project-level strategic equity partner/investor in the Prieska Project. Orion’s MD and CEO, Errol Smart, comments: “While we have made the decision to postpone debt financing activities for Prieska until global market conditions stabilise, we are fortunate that Orion will shortly be finalising its active Feasibility Study work and permitting activities, with a resultant reduction in spending requirements. "We will be able to weather the storm by dramatically reducing spending, while preserving a top-class, build-ready base metal project that can be activated as soon as global manufacturing and metal demand re-commences.”
