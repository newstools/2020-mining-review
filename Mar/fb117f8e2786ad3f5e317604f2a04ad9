Assore has, as a result of the increasing  incidents of COVID-19 in South Africa, taken the necessary steps to comply with the directives of the lockdown declared by President Ramaphosa. The Company, together with its joint venture partners, has taken the decision to prioritise the safety and health of its employees and contractors at this difficult time. Assmang, 50%-owned by Assore and jointly-controlled with African Rainbow Minerals, has put its iron ore mines (Beeshoek and Khumani), its manganese ore mines (Nchwaning and Gloria) and its smelter at Cato Ridge on care and maintenance. Likewise, Dwarsrivier Chrome Mine (Dwarsrivier) and Wonderstone (Wonderstone) have also been put on care and maintenance. Assmangâ€™s 54%-owned smelter in Sarawak, Malaysia continues to operate on a skeleton staffing arrangement. Accordingly, Assmang, Dwarsrivier and Wonderstone have all declared force majeure on customer, supplier and freight contracts. Assore is working closely with the affected customers and suppliers to manage the situation and the disruption this will cause. Assmang has received permission to operate its iron ore load-out facilities and will continue to rail on-mine stock to Saldanha port. However, shipments of iron ore will be constrained during this period. Assore would like to assure shareholders that the limited operations will be run strictly in accordance with DMRE concession regulations whilst ensuring that the safety of our people is maintained as a top priority. In addition, Assore has made it a priority to pay all its staff their full basic salary during the lockdown period and has undertaken to pay all suppliers on-time for goods and services received.
