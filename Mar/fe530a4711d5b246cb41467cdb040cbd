The Department of Environmental Affairs (DEA) in Botswana has granted the TSX-listed Giyani Metals final approval for the Environmental Management Plan (EMP) of its Lobatse manganese prospect. Botswana – The final approval was granted after the customary one-month public review process during which the company was required to advertise the details of the EMP in the government gazette and local newspapers. The public review process commenced on February 14, 2020 and concluded on March 13, 2020. There were no concerns raised by any stakeholders during that period and, as a result, the DEA issued an official acceptance letter on March 20, 2020. Robin Birchall, CEO of Giyani commented: “We are extremely
pleased with the final Lobatse EMP approval and grateful to the DEA in Botswana
for the speed and dedication in which they have complete their review.
This is another great example of Botswana’s dedication to supporting its
mining industry, especially as the country has introduced its own in-country
restrictions following the COVID-19 global pandemic; measures we are both
supporting in country and applaud. The environmental framework required to proceed with exploration
activities at Lobatse is now in place in order for Giyani to realise its full
potential including our efforts to expand the company’s manganese resource base
in Botswana. This approval is the last of the three that we have received
across K.Hill, Lobatse and Otse project sites.” Read: Giyani get financial backing for Botswana exploration About Giyani Metals Giyani Metals. is a Canadian explorer and developer focused on the development of its K.Hill, Lobatse and Otse manganese projects in the Kanye Basin, Botswana.
