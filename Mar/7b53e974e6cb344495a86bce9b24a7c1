Golden Star Resources is deeply saddened to report that a fatal accident occurred yesterday afternoon at our Prestea Gold Mine in Ghana. The incident occurred in the main access drive on 17 level which is currently being developed. The employee was fatally injured when he became trapped in the drive as one of the ore carts on a locomotive derailed. The relevant authorities have been notified and there will be a full investigation to establish the exact causes of the accident. As a sign of respect the company has suspended all activities underground at Prestea today. Andrew Wray, CEO of Golden Star, comments: "This is a tragic accident and all of our thoughts are with our colleague, his loved ones and the wider team at Prestea. "The accident will be investigated fully and we will redouble our efforts to make sure that we prevent anything of this nature from happening in the future. "We will also provide support for all those impacted by this accident."
