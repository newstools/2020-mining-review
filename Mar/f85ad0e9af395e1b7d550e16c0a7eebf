The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy says there have been no reported cases of COVID-19 in the mining sector. This comes after the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Gwede Mantashe, met with the leadership of the Minerals Council in Johannesburg to receive an update on plans in place for the sector to adequately respond to the current Coronavirus pandemic. President Cyril Ramaphosa has declared the outbreak a national disaster and outlined a comprehensive plan detailing how the country will respond in the short to medium term.

It will continue to engage with the sector on, among other things, the use of their medical facilities for the broader communities around mining operations, as well as the use of any safe and unoccupied housing facilities for quarantine, should the need arise. Mantashe says: “Working together we have made great strides on the health and safety front in the sector. We are confident that our continued partnership to proactively manage the humanitarian and economic impact of this pandemic on the sector, will go a long way.” For more information on the COVD-19 pandemic click here
