Orion Minerals has announced that Tembo Capital Mining Fund II LP has continued its strong support of Orion by providing a new unsecured $1.0 million loan facility. Under the terms of the Loan Facility, the Loan Amount, interest and any amount capitalised under the Loan Facility will be automatically set off against the amount to be paid by Tembo for the issue and allotment of ordinary shares in Orion Minerals to Tembo under any capital raising undertaken by Orion on or before 31 October 2020. If Orion Minerals does not undertake a capital raising by 31 October 2020, Tembo may elect to receive Shares in repayment of the Outstanding Amount, at an issue price of the 10-trading day ASX VWAP of the Shares, prior to the date that Tembo issues a conversion notice to Orion. Orion’s key focus is the completion of BFS optimisation studies for the development of the Prieska Copper-Zinc Project and preparations for mine construction. Value engineering and optimisation studies being undertaken since the completion of the BFS in June 2019 are delivering positive results, with key studies now concluded and an updated BFS due for completion shortly. Proceeds from the Loan Facility will be used principally to support Orion’s ongoing working capital requirements considering the current COVID-19 circumstances.
