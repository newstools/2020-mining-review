Exxaro, Eskom, Lephalale Local Municipality, Department of Health and Local Security cluster led by SAPS joined forces to officially launch a Lephalale based mass screening and testing campaign. This proactive approach seeks to detect the virus early and control further community local infections. The Lephalale Municipality established the Local Command Council where different stakeholders discuss plans and share ideas on how to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. It is in this forum that the stakeholders reached a consensus to put together a response plan in line with identified risks. “COVID-19 is an unprecedented pandemic requiring business solidarity to urgently respond. It is therefore one of the reasons why we as business felt that this mass screening campaign was necessary in our fight against COVID-19,” says Ronaldt Mafoko, General Manager, Exxaro Grootegeluk. The mass screening stations are situated at Lephalale entry points. As of the 3 May 2020, the teams had screened approximately 9,348 commuters passing by these two stations, and tested twelve patients who showed symptoms – fortunately none of the tested cases returned with a positive result. As a key strategic employer, Eskom General Managers Obakeng Mabotja, Zandi Shange and Wikus Van Janse Rensburg from Matimba and Medupi operations, unambiguously reiterated the need to keep the virus at bay – especially in Lephalale.
