The DRC’s copper mine output jumped 12.6% year-on-year in the first half of 2019 to 672 000 t, compared to 597 000 t in the prior year period, according to consulting Roskill. Demand for copper is also growing. It is essential for use in renewable energy systems that harness solar, hydro, thermal and wind power, with future increases in its demand expected as global car markets progress along the road towards greater electrification. Join Mining Review Africa, ESI Africa and DRC Mining Week as we unpack the importance of copper as a raw material in the global move toward greener energy and transportation.
