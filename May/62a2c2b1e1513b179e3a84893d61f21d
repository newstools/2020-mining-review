Junior mining investment company All Star Minerals has announced the first steps in a transformational transaction for the company, with the strengthening of its Board of Directors and the appointment of Ian Harebottle and Richard Lloyd. Ian is the former CEO of AIM-listed Gemfields, the world’s largest coloured gemstone company, and former COO and CEO of JSE and AIM listed TanzaniteOne. Ian Harebottle has a proven track record of success in the mining industry and gemstone sector in particular. During his combined 15 years managing the underlying activities of these companies, TanzaniteOne’s share price increase from 40 pence/share to more than 200 pence /share and was recognised as the largest dividend payer on AIM at the time. At Gemfields, upon his appointment in February 2009, he immediately implemented an aggressive turnaround strategy which saw Gemfields share price increase more than twenty-fold and its market capitalisation grow from approx. US$9 million to in excess of US$400 million. Ian was instrumental in developing and driving the corporate strategy, as well as the identification and acquisition of a number of key assets, including the now famous Montepuez Ruby Mine, the single largest ruby producing mine in the world. Richard Lloyd is a fellow of the Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining and the Geological Society and has over 25 years’ natural resources investment banking and mining geology experience. Ian Harebottle comments: “I am excited to be joining the board of All Star at this time. My background in the sector as former CEO of Gemfields alongside the board’s joint experience and history makes All Star a fairly unique proposition as we can utilise our relationships and sector specific knowledge to great benefit.”
