ASX-listed Minbos Resources has appointed Oreology Consulting to assist with work on the definitive feasibility study for its Cabinda phosphate project in Angola. Perth-based mine planning consultancy Oreology, which has specialist phosphate ore experience, has been engaged to produce an ore reserve report, designed to generate a robust mining strategy that maximises project value and efficiency. READ MORE: Minbos bid for Angolan phosphate concession a success The scope of work includes but is not limited to: The new mine plan to be developed by Orelogy is important for the mine approval process in Angola because it is expected to have a much lower environmental and social impact compared to previous studies, which required a tailings dam, water supply and a start-up production rate ten times larger than the current business case. The lower production rate is anticipated to reduce pit volumes requiring dewatering and enable in-pit waste disposal, resulting in minimal out of pit waste and water disposal, the ability to defer waterway diversions and significantly reduce mine and road traffic impacts. Minbos expects lower operating costs than previous studies due to lower fuel prices and the depreciation of the Kwanza against the US dollar. Minbos aims to move rapidly into production, using local phosphate rock, to produce fertilizer for local markets using technology developed by the International Fertilizer Development Center. “Our implementation plan is aggressive,” says Minbos Resources CEO Lindsay Reed, with several major milestones outlined in 2021/22.
