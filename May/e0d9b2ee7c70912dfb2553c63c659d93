Metso Corporation and Outotec Oyj have received an unconditional merger control clearance from the European Commission for the combination of Metsoâ€™s Minerals business with Outotec through a partial demerger of Metso. Since both Metso and Outotec issued a press release concerning regulatory approvals for the Combination on March 10, 2020, the companies have received unconditional clearances also from the competition authorities of a number of other jurisdictions, including Canada, Chile and Turkey. In line with the previous announcements, considering the progress of the regulatory approval process, Metso and Outotec continue to expect the completion of the Combination to take place on June 30, 2020, subject to the receipt of all required regulatory and other approvals, including certain remaining competition clearances.
