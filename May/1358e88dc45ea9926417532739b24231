Modern mining is continuously looking to improve capital expenditure, operating costs, flexible process systems due to complicated ores, improved environmental impact and the best possible recovery of mineral or minerals. Striving to achieve these points improves profitability and longevity of existing and new mines. Through years of intensive research and testing, Loesche has managed to improve process, recovery and optimisation technology of the plant.

Due to the dry process of the VRM, wet process equipment such as pumps, piping and cyclones can be removed which simplifies it even more reducing maintenance and spares holding costs. The VRM also allows for quick adjustment to suit the ore feed as it varies, allowing the mine to produce the best possible feed for the downstream process.

By this an improved flotation performance can be seen with a highly reduced reagent dosage, directly affecting the flotation kinetics for the better. This leads to better settling velocities and improved water recovery. Read more about the Vertical Roller Mill
