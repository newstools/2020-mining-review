Volt Resources has entered a Share Sale Deed to acquire an exciting gold project located in Guinea, Africa. The project comprises six permits in the prolific Siguiri Basin with a total area of 388 km2. The Company is also finalising a capital raising of $800,000 before costs through a share placement to sophisticated investors. Guinea gold project acquisition The Permits are located in the Suguiri Basin which forms part of the richly mineralised West African Birimian Gold Belt. Planning for exploration works on these under-explored permits is already underway and further information will be provided in coming weeks. Volt will continue to progress its graphite business plans and the current Stage 1 development funding program in relation to its Bunyu Graphite Project in Tanzania.
