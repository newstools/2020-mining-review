We’re bringing our lessons learnt into the future and to be perfectly honest, I didn’t believe when I wrote my editor’s comment for our April edition from the confines of my lockdown home, that I would be hitting the repeat button for the May edition. But here I am, an entire edition later, still sitting in my made-up office at home, contemplating what our new world will look like when lockdown is truly over. For South Africa, that will not be for a while still. On the plus side, open cast mining is back in business – 100%, while underground mining is allowed to ramp up to 50% and must stay that way until we move into Level 2. Webinar series: Digital DRC Mining Week 17-19 June I hope that the downstream impact on our supply sector will be quick and painless as new business picks up. I want to take this opportunity however to congratulate our industry. You have been resilient, strong, and taken the necessary drastic steps to protect your businesses and employees. It is good to recognise that safety is always your top priority – across all spectrums of the business, and that extends to home life. Webinar 9 June: Formalising artisanal mining in the DRC For those who have donated portions of their salaries or bonus structures to the country’s Solidarity Relief Fund, we are proud to call you leaders of our sector. No matter how the next few months / year pans out, Mining Review Africa remains here to support you and will do all we can to help rebuild your business and rebuild your name in this new world so that you can return to normal – albeit a new normal, but a normal nonetheless. My team has learnt some vital new tools – how to operate successfully in a virtual world reality – which I believe can only benefit ourselves and our clients moving forward. Stay safe!
