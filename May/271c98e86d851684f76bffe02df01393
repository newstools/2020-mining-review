We are going digital! Since COVID-19 has led to worldwide bans on mass gatherings and subsequent shuttering of expo’s and conferences, virtual events have allowed us to continue to stay in touch and engaged with our audiences. While we have been consistently evolving our digital offering over the past few years, no one could predict the almost immediate response that would be put in place to limit the spread of COVID-19. With a great foundation already in place, Mining Review Africa is embracing this move to digital by supporting Clarion Events Africa in the delivery of their events – virtually! We have successfully hosted a number of live webinars, the recordings of which can be accessed here. Here you will also find a list of our upcoming webinars for which you can register to attend. Out largest African event – DRC Mining Week – which was due to take place from 17-19 June, has been postponed to 7-9 October. Despite the postponement, we will be partnering with DRC Mining Week to bring you a series of free-to-attend monthly DRC-focused live Webinars, starting on 20 May, as well as the DRC Mining Week digital event that will take place virtually during the original week of the event in June. During this time of uncertainty, we have worked tirelessly on developing innovative ways for you to connect, communicate and exchange ideas with your industry peers.
