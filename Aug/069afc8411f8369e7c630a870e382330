Upon receipt of the force majeure notice from Eskom, and after consultation with its legal advisers, Exxaro said that the event does not constitute force majeure as stipulated in the coal supply agreements, as the power stations are still capable of supplying power. Exxaro also said that it would vigorously defend its position in this matter and take the necessary action. “As Eskom has been taking coal in accordance with the terms of the supply agreements, the impact of the force majeure event has been largely neutralised,” Exxaro said in a statement. Exxaro reaffirms its view that this event did not constitute a force majeure, as the power stations have been capable of supplying power and Exxaro continues to reserve its rights in this regard.
