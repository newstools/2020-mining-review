Orion Minerals has announced that its operating subsidiary, Prieska Copper – Zinc Mine, has been granted a 20-year Water Use Licence by the South African National Department of Water and Sanitation. This marks the achievement of another key permitting milestone for its development-ready Prieska Copper – Zinc Project in South Africa’s Northern Cape Province.

The Licence conditions make provision for further improvements to how water pumped out of the mine is disposed of, allowing the prospect of artificial recharge into groundwater aquifers to be considered, as well as maximising the re-use of the discharged water by farmers in the surrounding area.

Many of the banks and potential strategic partners that we have been dealing with have flagged the outstanding licence as a major concern that could potentially hold up an investment decision. “We are pleased that this key outstanding approval has now been received, clearing the way for construction and development of our planned new state-of-the-art base metal operation to commence at Prieska.”
