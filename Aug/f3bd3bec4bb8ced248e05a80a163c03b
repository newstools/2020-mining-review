Join us, together with Mining Review Africa for the second episode in a series of expert-led Webinars to help guide your African mining investment decisions. On the back of our first episode, which focused on the East African region, episode 2 will dive into emerging markets in West Africa that offer significant opportunities. The region is recognised as “new gold frontier” and an emerging gold investment hotspot in Africa. And our timing is great! West Africa has the biggest gold growth rate in the world, DESPITE the current pandemic. At present, 74% of all exploration projects are focusing on gold. Africa Mining Forum will dive into the current and future potential in Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire and Mali, where key investors and mining operators will share their experiences and expectations of the markets in those territories.
