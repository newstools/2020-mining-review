This notion is supported and encouraged in Zimbabwe by ZimTrade, the National Trade Development and Promotion Organization of the Republic of Zimbabwe. Through its close relationships with industry experts and development cooperation partners, it facilitates trade opportunities with local Zimbabwean companies and other mining-hot destinations in Africa, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The organisation is a true reflection of inter-regional trade and support for businesses in both Zimbabwe, the DRC and the rest of Africa. Join ZimTrade, Mining Review Africa and DRC Mining Week for a live discussion that will outline the extensive opportunities available in supporting the growth of the mining industry in the DRC through its local partners.
