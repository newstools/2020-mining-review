The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), with its abundant water resources, is ideally placed to support the development of both small and large-scale hydropower schemes. Hydropower has already successfully been used as a source of power by the mining industry, an example of which is the Azambi hydropower project, the third hydropower project developed by Barrick’s Kibali gold mine. Beyond this, other players in the industry are considering the viability of powering their mines using this environment-friendly technology. Join Mining Review Africa, ESI Africa, DRC Mining Week, and Knight Piesold as we examine the potential of hydroelectric power in the DRC, for the benefit of the mining industry and the surrounding communities.
