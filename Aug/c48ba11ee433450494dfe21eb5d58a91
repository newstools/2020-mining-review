And so do our clients and partners!” She explains: “Hence, we are embarking on a new journey, an Africa Mining Tour, and we promise we won’t just be tourists, but true travellers, diving deep into business destinations, commodity markets and project finance! Our tour is taking off and will be providing a full itinerary of first class content, engagement and, best of all, interaction between potential passengers for 365 days a year.” “Although we have had to postpone our live event in Kigali until November 2021,” Elodie continues, “we will host a five-day digital event from 16-20 November this year. But there is no time for any lay-overs, as we already have four exciting expert excursions lined up in the form of webinars in the run-up to the event, hosted in collaboration with our media partner, Mining Review Africa.” Webinars: Panellists:          – Rocky Smith, CEO | Peak Resources Limited          – Brian Menell, Chairman and CEO | TechMet Ltd          – Andrew Smith, President and CEO | East Africa Metals Inc          – Marcus Courage, CEO | Africa Practice Ltd Start your engines as we prepare for take-off“We don’t want to unveil too much too soon, but our digital event from 16-12 November this year will gather the best of African mining…” says Elodie. “Here is a sneak preview of what you can expect to be on the itinerary.” –Australia / Africa Investment– Strategic Markets in West Africa– Ministerial Forum– Finance & Investment / Junior Mining– DRC Focus Day– Women in Mining Assembly– CEO Forum– Power to the Mines – Building a Processing Industry– Build your COVID-19 Recovery Plan– African Commodities Outlook: 12 months, 5 years and 10 years from now “Stay tuned to get updates in the next few weeks as we are finalising bookings and loading our cargo.
