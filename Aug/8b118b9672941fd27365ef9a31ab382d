Contango Holdings has signed a Letter of Intent with CoalZim Marketing relating to an offtake agreement for coal products produced at the Company’s Lubu Coalfield Project in Zimbabwe. Carl Esprey, Executive Director of Contango Holdings, says: “The delivery of another LOI, within 10 days of securing our first agreement with South Mining, further highlights the strong demand dynamics for our coal products within Zimbabwe.
