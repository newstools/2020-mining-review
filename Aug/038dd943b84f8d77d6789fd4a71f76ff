Did you know that in Sub-Saharan Africa, the energy-intensive users group (whose membership comprises nearly 50% of mine operations) consumes over 40% of the electricity produced in South Africa? Given the need to increase energy supply in a globally carbon-constrained environment, the mining sector needs to gear up with energy-efficient technologies, such as electrical variable speed drives which can reduce energy consumption by up to 60%. Fixed speed motors have by comparison become recognised for their energy wastage, making VSPs a requisite, not a luxury. Join Mining Review Africa and Danfoss for an informative webinar which aims to showcase how Danfoss Drives can assist in optimising energy efficiency in mining.
