In August, the country had reported upwards of 40 000 positive cases. This has created an unprecedented period of uncertainty for the country, which has seen federal and state governments put in place several processes to mitigate the spread of the virus and showcase the nation’s leading response to dealing with the pandemic. Regardless of the challenges that may lie ahead, the Nigerian mining industry offers considerable financial gains. It is home to abundant, untapped mineral reserves, and the government is focused on increasing the country’s business investment attraction to exploit these. With a growth strategy in place and in play, the mining sector is poised for short and mid-term growth as investors move to capitalise on opportunities in iron ore, gold, zinc and lead, amongst others. Join Nigeria Mining Week and Mining Review Africa for a Webinar that will outline the Nigerian story – what has been achieved in recent years, what are the lessons learned and what are the next steps to grow the industry in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic?
