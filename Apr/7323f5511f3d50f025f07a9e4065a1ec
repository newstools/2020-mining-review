Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy Gwede Mantashe conducted unannounced mine visits at three colliers in Mpumalanga to assess compliance by mining companies to the nationwide lockdown regulations. The three coal mines visited on Tuesday 31 March 2020, all of which supply coal to Eskom, include Glencore’s Impunzi Colliery, Exxaro’s Matla Coal and Seriti Resources’ Kriel Colliery.

opportunity to assess the implementation of the directive and guiding
principles issued by the Department to all mines on how to manage risks associated
with COVID-19 at an operational level, in line with provisions in the Mine Health
and Safety Act. All mines are required to, among others, conduct a risk-based assessment covering all workings at mines, reduce numbers of employees transported on common transport per shift, and where applicable, reduce the number of shifts per day.

There are currently three confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the mining and energy sectors – one each in Gauteng, Mpumalanga and the Western Cape. “The mines are not at the same level in terms of their state of readiness to deal with the pandemic and we are encouraging all mines to work together with employers and labour unions to share best practice and ensure their systems are complementary, in order to proactively manage risks beyond each mine,” the Minister said. The readiness of power utilities receiving this coal is of equal importance during this pandemic.
