Transfer chute specialist Weba Chute Systems has further upgraded its Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment (BBBEE) rating to Level 2. According to Farouk Abrahams, sales director
at Weba Chute Systems, it was a focus on skills and enterprise development that
led to the ratings improvement. “We continue to transform from within to ensure that the business contributes to economic inclusion and job creation,” Abrahams says. “Particular effort was recently invested in our supply chain, to reward those suppliers that embrace transformation while upholding the highest levels of quality.” Formed more than 25 years ago in South Africa,
Weba Chute Systems engineers and manufactures fit-for-purpose transfer chute
solutions for mining and industrial applications around the world. There are
now over 4 500 of its installations operating globally. Each chute’s engineered design controls the material’s
direction, flow and velocity, reducing equipment wear and dust emissions. Abrahams notes that an empowerment deal in
2014 brought black ownership into the business and also helped foster the
transformation of management control. “Our contribution to empowerment includes supporting skills training such as learnerships and internships,” he says. “We are also considering a bursary scheme for school leavers, focused on engineering skills that are aligned to the requirements of companies like ours.” He highlights that Weba Chute Systems’ transformation
journey – while helping build a more inclusive economy – helped customers meet
their own B-BBEE objectives. “By constantly raising our game to improve our
empowerment rating, we are pleased to be adding further value by helping our
customers meet their legal and operational requirements,” he says. The company’s position as a leading local supplier to the mining sector also contributes to growing the level of local content procured by mining companies, as required by the Mining Charter.
