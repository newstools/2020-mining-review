The Department of Mineral Resources and Energy (DMRE) has issued a directive to all mining operations to ensure safe start-up procedures. The directive comes as the sector prepares to ramp up to 50% of capacity. The directive is issued to ensure compliance with Section 5(1) of the Mine Health and Safety Act (Act No. 29 of 1996), as amended, which requires that every employer must as far as reasonably practicable, provide and maintain a safe working environment. The start-up procedures must also address measures to be taken to prevent the spread of COVID-19, as well as actions to provide a safe working environment, especially following the prolonged closure of some operations. These measures should include: Read: Life after lockdown: 10 legal considerations to take into account Ongoing monitoring required The directive also encourages employers to systematically phase in workers at the mines. In line with the directive, mining companies must, in consultation with labour unions in the respective operations, develop the start-up procedure, and provide a copy to the DMRE, prior to ramp-up of operations. The nature and extent of the covid-19 pandemic is dynamic, unpredictable and changes almost daily as new scientific research about the virus becomes available. This calls for an equally dynamic response from government and society as a whole. According to the directive, the DMRE will continue to introduce specific and appropriate measures for the sector when required. In addition, the department will continue with scheduled and unannounced visits to mining operations to monitor compliance with the lockdown regulations, guiding principles on prevention and management of Covid-19, as well as the start-up procedure.
