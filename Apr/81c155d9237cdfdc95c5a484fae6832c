In our April edition of Mining Review Africa, which is goes live on our website today, we focus on the Democratic Republic of Congo and how it is still teeming with mining potential. Our editorial team has been inundated with news from the majority of the sector – both in South Africa and the rest of Africa – providing comprehensive detail on the steps, measures and plans being taken to mitigate and control on site environments to prevent or reduce the possibility of infection. South Africa in particular has a greater challenge ahead as the lockdown requires that all non-essential operations (basically everything except our coal mines) move onto care and maintenance during the shutdown. The impact this will have on our economy, our mines and all the contractors who work for them is immeasurable. Nonetheless, no one disagrees that this is the necessary action required to protect our nation from far worse effects in the long-run. In fact, this sentiment extends beyond our sector and I’ve seen South Africans come together to support each other, ironic considering we must do it apart. The show of admiration and respect for our President’s decision to embark on a lengthy lockdown is testimony to the support we have as a country and our commitment to do what is necessary to protect ourselves and each other. I wish all our readers and their families strength and peace as we move forward through this very difficult time, one we have never experienced before. Not only do I truly hope that we come out of this a stronger community, but that we are reminded that we only have one planet (which is now recovering from the reduce effects of pollution, etc.) and one chance to make a positive difference for our future generations.
