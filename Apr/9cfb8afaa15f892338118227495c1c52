Barrick Gold Corporation’s country manager for Côte d’Ivoire, Bodiel N’Diaye, donated $1.3 million to Minister of Mines Jean Claude Kouassi to support Côte d’Ivoire in its campaign against the Covid-19 pandemic. The donation will be used for medical and social aid, including the provision of protective equipment and sanitary materials. $850,000 of that amount will be allocated at a national level, $320,000 at a regional level and $135,000 will go to the district and communities around Barrick’s Tongon mine. Barrick owns and operates the Tongon gold mine in Côte d’Ivoire and has a long history of partnering with the government and local communities, including in the field of community health. N’Diaye said extensive preventative and control measures had already been implemented at Tongon, but in the light of its long-standing commitment to the country and the potential scale of the pandemic, Barrick deemed it necessary to also make a contribution at the national level.
