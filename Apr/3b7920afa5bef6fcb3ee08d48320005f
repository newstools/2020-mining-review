TSX-listed Roxgold has delivered a robust Preliminary Economic Assessment (PEA) for its high-grade Séguéla gold project in Côte d’Ivoire. Côte d’Ivoire – The PEA was prepared in accordance with Canadian Securities Administrators’ National Instrument 43-101 Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (NI 43-101). It provides a base case assessment of developing the Antenna, Ancien, Agouti and Boulder deposits as open pit mines feeding a central gold processing facility. The Séguéla gold project is located approximately 240 kilometres north-west of Yamoussoukro, the political capital of Côte d’Ivoire, and approximately 480 kilometres north-west of Abidjan, the commercial capital of the country. It covers an area of 36,300 hectares, defined by two exploration permits. Roxgold expects to continue its evaluation of Séguéla with the intent of growing the resource base and advancing to the feasibility stage. Key Highlights John Dorward, president and CEO commented: “The PEA illustrates the substantial value accretion of Séguéla which stands alongside our current operations to build the foundation for Roxgold and its future. We have identified several opportunities to expand and optimize the PEA, which we intend to evaluate as we proceed towards a Feasibility Study, which is well underway and with an anticipated completion in the first half of 2021.”
