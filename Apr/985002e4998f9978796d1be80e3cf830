Critical pumps in the provision of water and sanitation services, as well as pumps used in the generation of electricity are being fully supported during the nationwide COVID-19 lock down period. KSB Pumps and Valves, has far-reaching contingency plans in place to ensure that any of its mission-critical pumps and other pumping infrastructure across industries will be properly supported. Company spokesman, David Jones, regional sales manager for sub-Saharan Africa, says the company supplies largescale pumps for the distribution of potable water to the entire southern African region. “During this time of COVID-19 crisis, we will do everything in our power to support our water utilities and municipalities water infrastructure to ensure uninterrupted supply of clean water to all communities. “The same applies to sanitation services where wastewater
and sewerage handling is equally important to fight diseases and infection. Our
workmen, technicians and engineers are on round-the-clock standby to ensure that
pumps in these services run smoothly.” Jones adds that KSB Pumps and Valves has also played a crucial role in retrofitting and rejuvenating old pumps and steam valves in Eskom’s power station fleet in order to keep the country’s lights burning. Along with its modern equipment in newer power stations the company’s full support and vast expertise will be critical to ensure uninterrupted power during the shutdown. Pumping infrastructure for other mission critical operations
such as supporting the country’s vast petrochemical operations, dewatering
mines, pollution mitigation, agricultural and other operations will also
receive technical assistance from the company. “Although day-to-day operations at KSB Pumps have ceased in accordance with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s shutdown directives, it is our duty to provide robust technical and support services to mission critical services and industries,” concludes Jones.
