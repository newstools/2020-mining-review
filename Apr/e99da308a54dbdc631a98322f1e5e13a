TSX-listed African
Gold Group says that it is progressing steadily towards the completion of
the definitive feasibility study (DFS) at its Kobada gold project in Mali. Mali – The
announcement comes after African Gold Group announced that it had discovered additional
high-grade intersections in the northern extension of the main shear zone of
the project. Highlights include: Dr. Andreas Rompel, VP: Exploration of the company stated, “We
still encounter high-grade mineralisation moving northwards beyond the planned
open pit along strike and down dip, proving the yet open-ended extension
northwards and along dip beyond the saprolite zone. Furthermore, we are testing
the width of the Kobada Shear and are happy to see that it extends further
westwards than anticipated in parts.” Read: Mali government firmly committed to mining industry Company looking at other interests Kobada is a fully licensed and permitted advanced development project located in the prolific Birimian Greenstone belt in Southern Mali. Africa Gold Group is working towards delivering the DFS in Q2 2020 as a part of the final process before the commencement of construction. Since 2019, the company has completed a drilling campaign totalling 11,428 m within the concession area. To date, the company has not discovered the northern or the
southern end of mineralization along the Kobada Shear. Furthermore, the company
intends to step away from the Kobada Shear to test the neighbouring and
parallel-striking Gosso Shear, which has been exposed by shallow artisanal
mining. Results from the drilling programme will be incorporated into an updated mineral resource statement targeted to be released within the next few weeks.
