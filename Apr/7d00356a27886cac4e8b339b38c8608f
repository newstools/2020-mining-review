The amount has been contributed jointly by Barrick and its West African logistics partner, CSTTAO. Mbaye informed the minister that the company was also supporting nine villages in its Bambadji permit area as well as the Saraya and Kedougou hospitals. In addition, he said Barrick would assist with the procurement andsupply of personal protection equipment through CSTTAO. Of the amount donated, $850,000 would be allocated at a national level, $10,000 at a regional level, $55,000 would go to district and local communities and$57,000 to the Kedougou hospital. Barrick president and chief executive Mark Bristow noted that Barrick, through its legacy company Randgold, had been engaged in Senegal since 1995. “We have made this donation in the hope that it will help strengthen the government’s hand in its fight against Covid-19 and also to demonstrate our continuing partnership with and commitment to Senegal and its people,”he said. Barrick last month combined its Massawa project in Senegal with Teranga Gold Corporation’s nearby Sabodala mine. Barrick has retained an 11% interest in the combined asset and Bristow said the company looked forward to contributing to the value it would create for all stakeholders.
