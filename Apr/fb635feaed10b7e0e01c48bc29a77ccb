ASX-listed explorer Lotus Resources has defined near mine and Brownfield exploration targets of between 6 Mt to 22 Mt, containing between 7 Mlb to 14 Mlb of uranium oxide at a grade of 300 to 600 ppm of U3O8 at its recently acquired Kayelekera uranium project in Malawi. Potential further exploration upside on Greenfield targets exist and will need to be drill tested in order to prove up. Lotus Resources completed the acquisition of a 65% interest in the high-grade Kayelekera uranium project from Paladin Energy in early March 2020. The remaining 35% is held by Lotus’s joint venture partner Chichewa (20%) and the Government of Malawi (15%). Lotus will have an option to acquire a further 20% interest in Kayelekera from Chichewa. The release of the exploration targets follows an exploration review undertaken by the company, in which it reviewed the existing exploration dataset including 1 780 drill holes, surface and airborne geophysics, and surface sampling. The four priority regional targets identified for exploration include: On March

2019, when it initially announced its intention to acquire the operation. The total mineral resource comprises the following: The Kayelekera mine, which was placed on care and maintenance in 2014 due to the sustained low uranium spot price, produced 10.9 Mlb while in operation.
