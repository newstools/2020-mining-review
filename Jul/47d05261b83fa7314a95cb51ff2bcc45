In the first episode, experts will examine what investors and key mining companies consider to be the hottest mining destinations in East Africa. The region is richly endowed with mineral resources that have yet to be exploited and offer attractive investment opportunities â€“ especially as lockdown measures to contain the pandemic are eased and the reopening of the economies continues to boost metals prices. The good news is that key regions in East Africa are home to some of the most in-demand metals and minerals, including Tanzania, Rwanda and Ethiopia.
