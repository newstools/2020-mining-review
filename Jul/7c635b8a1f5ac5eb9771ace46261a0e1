Gold producer B2Gold Corp., which operates the Otjikoto mine in Namibia, has contributed US$2 million to assist the Namibian government’s COVID-19 relief programme. This is the largest private sector contribution to the country’s relief fund, and is in addition to the $240 000 which the company contributed in April 2020. These funds will assist in the purchase of personal protection equipment, food relief packages and hospital equipment (including ventilators) to assist healthcare and frontline workers dealing with the virus and its impact on local populations. B2Gold’s support will be channelled through Namibia’s Disaster Relief Fund which was established under the Emergency Management Unit of the Office of the Prime Minister. The Unit is responsible for mobilising resources locally and internationally during a national emergency such as the COVID-19 pandemic. “B2Gold is proud to assist the Namibian government in dealing with the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our contribution demonstrates B2Gold’s sincere commitment to improve the livelihoods of all Namibians,” says B2Gold President and CEO Clive Johnson.
