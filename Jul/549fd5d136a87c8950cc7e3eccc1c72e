One of the objectives is to encourage the development of Nigeria’s downstream sector: beneficiation, processing and trade – which has been highlighted by role players in the field as a necessity to break growth barriers. As lockdown measures in Nigeria are eased and the economy reopened, growing the country’s broader mining and minerals industry will be prioritised with the objective of sharing prosperity for all stakeholders by increasing investment opportunities while minimising import dependency and increasing contribution to the GDP. Join Mining Review Africa, Nigeria Mining Week and PwC for a live panel discussion which will focus on what measures are being put in place to deliver on this strategy and what key role players in the beneficiation and mining sector are saying.
