The acquisition is subject to customary regulatory approvals. James Campbell, MD, comments: “KX36 is the most significant diamond discovery in Botswana since Orapa and Jwaneng. KX36, together with its associated Prospecting Licenses, adds scale to the Company’s Sunland and Maibwe JV properties in the Kalahari. “Botswana Diamonds will refine resource estimates of KX36, and development options. The Sekaka exploration database adds to Botswana Diamonds’ extensive database, improving our diamond exploration programme, particularly in the Kalahari where we are currently focused.” John Teeling, Chairman, comments: “ This is an important step forward for BOD.

KX36, located deep in the Kalahari, presents challenges, but the greatest challenge of all is overcome – finding a significantly sized high-grade deposit. We have evaluated options on KX36 and believe we can add value to the discovery.” Read more about Botswana Diamonds
