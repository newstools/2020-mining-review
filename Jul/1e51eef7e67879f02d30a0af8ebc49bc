AIM-listed exploration and mine development company, Arc Minerals, has commenced drilling at its Zamsort and Zaco license areas in north western Zambia. Zambia – Diamond drilling activities will commence over the Fwiji Target Arc Minerals has already defined the target area through previous exploratory works. Follow up work at a number of the other target areas, including Cheyeza East and Muswema, is also currently underway. The total diamond drilling programme for the year is budgeted for an initial 8 000 m with hole depths to between 100 m and 250 m below surface. Progress amid pandemic Diamond drilling is initially intended to confirm the interpreted anticlinal structure and mineralisation associated with the hinge component to this anticline. This will then be followed to test the mineralisation in the down-plunge hinge component to the anticline. Nick von Schirnding, executive chairman of Arc Minerals commented, “I am very pleased to report the commencement of drilling activities at Fwiji, notwithstanding the challenges of COVID-19.  Our team in Zambia has worked hard to get around the obvious challenges posed by the pandemic. I look forward to regular updates to the market over the exploration season.” Read: Arc Minerals increases interest in Zamsort Background The Fwiji target area has been confirmed by both the soil sampling and airborne geophysical programmes and is situated on the northern limb of the Nyambwezu Syncline. The area is dominated by an open, south westerly plunging anticline, as defined by the Lower Roan quartzite ridge. The current interpretation for Fwiji postulates that the copper mineralization is hosted in the hinge of plunging south westerly anticline. Near surface oxide mineralization is expected to be intersected with the primary sulphide mineralization down plunge.
