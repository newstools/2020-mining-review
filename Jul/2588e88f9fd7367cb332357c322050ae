Rare earths developer Pensana Rare Earths has appointed Paradigm Project Management as the owner’s representative for the Longonjo NdPr project in Angola, on behalf of Pensana. Paradigm brings an Afri-centric engineering capacity to the team and will co-ordinate the bankable feasibility study (BFS) and deliver the front-end engineering design (FEED) for Longonjo’s power, water and waste services, offices, workshops, camp infrastructure and off-mine facilities including the rail and port side facilities.

SRK Consulting is working towards a revised mineral resource estimate due in September and Snowden is preparing the open pit mine optimisation, design and cost studies for the BFS which is due mid-October. “We are delighted to add Paradigm to our team of consultants. Paradigm has an impressive track record of delivery of sub-Saharan African mining projects and are looking to accelerate Longonjo’s development in order that we can commence construction in the first quarter 2021,” says Pensana Rare Earts CEO Tim George. Paradigm Project Management director Jeremy Clarke says Longonjo is an exciting project and fits well with the company’s approach to move directly from prefeasibility study to FEED, which will significantly reduce the time and costs associated with reaching positive cash flows. Located only 4 km from the modern rail line, leading directly into an Atlantic port, Longonjo leverages excellent transport connections. The potentially free dig offers a low waste-to-ore ratio, coupled with high-grade surface mineralisation, which together with the favourable location and the transport infrastructure already in place, distinguish Longonjo from the majority of other rare earth projects.
