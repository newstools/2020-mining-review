Despite disruptions during Q1 2020, global coal production is expected to grow, albeit by a marginal 0.1% to 8.13 billion tonnes (Bnt) in 2020, says GlobalData. A 7.8% fall in production in the US will be a major factor in the overall limited output. However, this will be offset by an increase in production from India (8.3%), Indonesia (5%) and Russia (3%), as coal mines continued to operate due to the essential status governments assigned to them amid lockdown. Vinneth Bajaj, Senior Mining Analyst GlobalData, comments: “Disruption during Q1 2020 was most significant in China, but owing to the virus being well contained from the beginning of the second quarter, the country reported a marginal 0.9% y-o-y growth for the first five months of 2020.

Production will be supported by increased production by South Eastern Coalfields and Mahanadi Coalfields, as they recover from the impacts of the severe monsoon and labor strikes in 2019. Bajaj continues: “Over the next four years, global coal production is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.2% to reach 8.9Bnt by 2024, due to increasing supply from India (6.1%) and China (2.3%).
