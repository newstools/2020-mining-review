While respecting COVID-19 lockdown and other regulations, Multotec has assured customers globally of its technical and sales support, especially to operations declared as essential services. As a global company serving six continents, Multotec has operations in Canada, Chile, Australia, Europe, China, Ghana, Zambia, Botswana, Mozambique and South Africa. “We certainly find ourselves in challenging times and the global COVID-19 pandemic is giving us the opportunity of modifying the way we do business across the world,” says Multotec CEO Thomas Holtz. “Our manufacturing facilities in China are fully operational, while our facilities in Canada, Chile and Australia are in various stages of operational capacity,” he says. “We have committed to working on weekends and over public holidays over the next months to ensure any order backlogs are caught up and there is the least possible disruption.” Holtz highlights that where some countries’ mining and power generation operations have been declared by their governments as essential services, Multotec is providing full product and service support from its local bases in these locations. “The safety of our staff and customers is an absolute priority and every precaution is being taken to ensure the continued health of all our stakeholders,” he says. “At the same time, please be assured that – as far as possible and using various means – we continue to provide full technical and sales support to all our customers, wherever they may be.” Read more about COVID-19 Multotec has taken the worldwide travel restrictions as an opportunity to run online training workshops in multiple languages with many customers in remote locations.
