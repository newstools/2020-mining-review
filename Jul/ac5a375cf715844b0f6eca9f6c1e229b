TSX-listed Desert Gold Ventures has acquired the rights to a 95% interest in the Sola West concession in Western Mali. Mali – The 16 km2 Sola West concession, fills a strategic, approximate 4 km property gap, on Desert West’s Senegal Mali Shear Zone ‘SMSZ) project between the northeast-trending Barani East Zone, with intercepts to 7.83 g/t gold over 13m, and the recently drilled Soa Prospect, which returned an intercept of 2.02 g/t gold over 30m. Including the Sola West concession, SMSZ is now approximately 410 km2. The SMSZ project is both named after and overlies a 38 km section of the Senegal Mali Shear Zone which is related to five large mines located to the north and south, along strike, including B2Gold’s Fekola Mine, Barrick’s Gounkoto and Loulo mines and AngloGold Ashanti/IAMGOLD’s Sadiola and Yatela mines. To the company’s knowledge, SMSZ is the largest, contiguous, non-producer land package over this very prospective structural feature.

Filling gaps like Sola West are important given the fact that the mineralised systems both to the northeast and southwest, along strike, likely continue onto the Sola West property package. “The presence of significant artisanal mining and strong gold-in-soil anomalies further augment the perspectivity of Sola West. Weather and time permitting, we plan to drill test some of these targets during our current drill programme.” Desert Gold’s SMSZ exploration programme is ongoing with one combination diamond/RC/AC drill and two auger drills, with a third auger drill expected to be added soon. Approximately 10 000m of auger drilling is planned. Results will be presented in late July or early August once assays have been received and interpreted.
