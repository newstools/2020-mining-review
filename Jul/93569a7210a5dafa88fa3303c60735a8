Kumba has announced the approval of its Kapstevel South project at its Kolomela mine by both the Company and Anglo American’s boards. The total capital cost of the project will be approximately R7 billion, including pre-stripping. It is anticipated that the addition of the Kapstevel South pit will deliver an after-tax internal rate of return of ~25% and allow Kolomela to maintain an estimated EBITDA margin of >35% in the long-term. The project entails the development of a new pit, Kapstevel South and associated infrastructure at Kolomela. The pit is a conventional truck and shovel operation producing high quality direct shipping ore (DSO). Whilst the pit is included in the current life of mine, it contributes significantly to sustaining production of ~13 Mt for the remaining life of mine.
