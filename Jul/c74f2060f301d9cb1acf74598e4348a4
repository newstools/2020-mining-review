Not only are these minerals abundant in the DRC, but are already being mined or are in the process of development. Join Mining Review Africa and DRC Mining Week as we unpack the extent of battery metal mineralisation in the DRC, how the country is positioned to feed increasing demand over the coming years, why you should consider investing in the development of these metals and minerals in the DRC and who is already benefiting from building their businesses around these metals and minerals in the Central African territory.
