Orezone Gold has announced that Burkina Faso’s National Commission of Mines has approved the modification of the Bomboré mining permit to include all aspects of the future Phase II Expansion. This follows on from the recent environmental (ESIA) approval received in April 2020. The approval encompasses the Phase II mining and processing of higher-grade fresh rock and lower transition reserves, and the high-grade P17S deposit, in addition to the Phase I oxide reserves covered under the original mining permit. Patrick Downey, President and CEO comments: “We have now received all major permitting required to execute on the mine plan in the 2019 feasibility study for the Bomboré Gold Project. “We can now look forward to finalizing project financing and starting full scale construction in the near future. “We would also like to thank the Government of Burkina Faso and the local communities for their continued support.”
