Royal Bafokeng Platinum (RBPlat) together with the North West Provincial Department of Health has opened a 200-bed Royal Bafokeng Platinum Field Hospital in Rustenburg, at a cost of approximately R10 million, to support government’s already overburdened resources in the fight against COVID-19. Working with the North West Provincial Department of Health and the Bojanala District Health Department, RBPlat converted its unused Maseve Mine, South Shaft Change House in the North West Province, into a 200-bed Field Hospital to provide initial COVID-19 medical treatment to its employees and communities. The 2 940 m² treatment facility includes five wards, each with separate beds. Each bed has its own television and personal lockable locker to store patient valuables and is individually screened off from other patient beds for privacy. The wards have all been installed with sani-disc ultraviolet lights to kill any airborne diseases, as well as 108 caribbean 2 000 W infrared heaters. The facility is well-ventilated and can cater for mild to moderate COVID-19 positive cases, supported with all the medical facilities and healthcare professionals as required. Speaking at the official opening, Steve Phiri, CEO of RBPlat said: ‘The global COVID-19 pandemic and the steadily increasing rise in positive cases in South Africa, is a cause for concern and has encouraged us to identify projects that can offer support to our employees, our communities and the government. “We have already implemented several projects to support the needy and vulnerable in our community, as well as sourced quarantine and isolation facilities at Sundown Ranch for our employees and the community, to be used as required.
