Results of 3D magnetic modelling show extended gold mineralisation at TSX-listed Asante Gold Corporation’s Kubi project in Ghana. Ghana – The results show that the Kubi Main Zone gold resource is intimately associated with, and interfingers, the western sheared contact of a magnetic high feature that plunges to more than 2km in depth. In Ghana, Africa’s largest gold producer, many big mines are located along north east trending regional shear systems that exceed 250km in length. Studies indicate that the hydrothermal gold mineralising system that generated the Ashanti Gold belt deposits was gigantic and extended to a least 10km to 15km in depth. The Ashanti shear zone hosts the largest single gold resource in Ghana, the 66 Moz Obuasi mine. This major shear zone cuts Kubi 15km south west of Obuasi. At Obuasi a typical ore shoot contains 3 Moz at head grades of 10 to 15g/t gold and plunges to more than 2km in depth. Fine refractory gold occurs in arsenopyrite disseminated with pyrrhotite and pyrite, with free milling coarse gold in late quartz veins. Read: Kubi back in the spotlight Resource bigger than original estimates At Kubi the gold is free milling and occurs within a 1km long by 1 m to 15 m thick shear bounded ‘garnet’ zone. Gold is associated with up to 30% garnet and 15% sulfide mineralisation including pyrite, pyrrhotite and arsenopyrite, and also occurs as coarse gold in late quartz veins. In the 66 312 metres of diamond core drilling from 226 drill holes used for the Kubi Main Zone mineral resource estimate, there were 83 drill core assays greater than 10.0 g/t and ranging to 98.1 g/t, highlighting the high-grade potential of the mineralising fluids. Asante’s CEO, Douglas MacQuarrie, CEO stated, “Magnetic modelling has shown that the structure that hosts the Kubi deposit extends more than 2 km below the Kubi pit and could represent a feeder zone to the mineralisation. “This interpretation suggests that Kubi may be much larger than previously thought, with an exploration potential of 2 Moz to a depth of 2 km. Further 3D modelling to incorporate additional geophysical and geological information is underway to refine the interpretation.” Kubi Main Zone has a current NI 43-101 resource estimate comprising: Measured resources 0.66 million tonnes @ 5.30g/t for 112 000 ounces; indicated resources 0.66 million tonnes @ 5.65g/t for 121 000 oz; and inferred resources 0.67 million tonnes @ 5.31g/t for 115 000 oz.
