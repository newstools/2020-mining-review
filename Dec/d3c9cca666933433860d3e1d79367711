Mining supply chain due diligence easier thanks to blockchainIn this episode of the Modernisation in Mining podcast series, Mining Review Africa Senior Deputy Editor Chantelle Kotze speaks to Minespider founder and CEO Nathan Williams about how blockchain is increasingly being used in the mining sector to provide assurance, transparency and traceability within the raw materials supply chain, placing the spotlight on the responsible sourcing of these metals and minerals, particularly those mined in conflict or high-risk zones. We also take a closer look at the Minespider blockchain protocol for responsible raw material tracking and the Ore Source due diligence product (an application built on top of the Minespider blockchain) that helps mines and smelters capture key information that importers can use to access the data on the materials they purchase.
