AIM-listed Oriole Resources has reported that rock-chip results from its Bibemi gold project in Cameroon has extended the known gold system to 8.3 km. Cameroon – Recent mapping and selective rock-chip sampling to the south west of the main Bakassi area has identified two new prospects, Lawa West and Lawa East, which have returned results of up to 11.68 g/t Au and 22.38 g/t Au respectively. The results have extended the known gold system at Bibemi by 3 km to 8.3 km and mineralisation remains open to the south west. Oriole plans to test the new prospects with eight drill holes and, together with a further three holes at Bakassi Zone 1, the planned maiden diamond drilling programme now stands at 28 holes for 3 080 m. The rig is now expected to arrive in Cameroon later this month, following minor delays as a result of the impact of COVID-19 on the global shipping industry. Subject to any further delays, Oriole anticipates commencing the programme in January 2021, with results expected later in Q1 and into Q2. READ: Oriole to expand footprint in Cameroon On track despite COVID-19 delays Oriole Resources CEO, Tim Livesey, said, “The continued presence of high-grade gold mineralisation confirms the prospectivity of the Bibemi project, now outside of the central Bakassi area where we had already planned a 20-hole diamond drilling programme. This recent identification of vein swarms at the new prospects, supports the possibility of structurally controlled, higher volume areas of mineralisation, and we are pleased to have expanded the programme to enable testing of them. “Each progressive programme at Bibemi has returned yet more evidence of gold mineralisation and continues to support our exploration model and our early ideas on the structural controls on the mineralising system. Though frustrated by the small delay to the arrival of the drilling equipment, we are still on track to be seeing results at Bibemi in Q1 2021.”
