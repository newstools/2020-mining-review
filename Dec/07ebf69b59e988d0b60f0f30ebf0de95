Botswana Diamonds has reported the discovery of a new kimberlite “blow” located on its Thorny River project in South Africa. The blow was discovered during recent drilling programme and covers a target area of 0.4 ha.

A combined total of 39.5 m intersected kimberlite while an additional 55 m intersected a weathered kimberlite breccia. The best hole contained a down-the-hole (at forty-five degrees dip) intersection of kimberlite and kimberlite breccia of 19 m. Both kimberlite and kimberlite breccia are being analysed for diamonds and indicators. Botswana Diamonds have enough data to construct a preliminary 3D model of the resource and to estimate kimberlite volumes. Following this the company will perform core drilling to confirm the precise geology and kimberlite profile. Drilling on the Marsfontein targets discovered no additional extensions to the M8 kimberlite. The focus on this property will be on the diamondiferous alluvial deposits confirmed by the company’s recent geophysics programme and by Professor Tania Marshall, the current Chairperson of the SamCode Standards Committee and a recognised expert in the geology and assessment of diamondiferous alluvial deposits. A further five targets will be drilled in the Thorny River area soon.
