AIM and BSE-listed Botswana Diamonds has reported the discovery of a new kimberlite “blow” (i.e. a small pipe) located on its Thorny River project in South Africa. South Africa – The blow was discovered during the company’s recent drilling programme and covers a target area of 0.4 hectares. Botswana Diamonds chairman, John Teeling, commented, “This is very significant as the nearby Marsfontein (0.4 hectares) and Sugarbird (0.5 hectares) blows were extremely profitable diamond-producing operations. We are moving forward with a programme to define the extent of this new resource particularly as the diamond grades are known to be consistent across the whole area”. A total of six holes were drilled in the Thorny River area. A combined total of 39.5 m intersected kimberlite while an additional 55 m intersected a weathered kimberlite breccia.  The best hole contained a down-the-hole (at 45 degrees dip) intersection of kimberlite and kimberlite breccia of 19 m.  Both kimberlite and kimberlite breccia are being analysed for diamonds and indicators.

Following this Botswana Diamonds will perform core drilling to confirm the precise geology and kimberlite profile. A further five targets will be drilled in the Thorny River area in the near future. In November, Botswana Diamonds commenced drilling on its Thorny River and Marsfontein project areas. The multi-hole drilling programme commenced on the four target areas that were identified as high interest in a recent detailed ground geophysics survey.
