Orion Minerals’ Prieska underground zinc-copper project in South Africa’s Northern Cape falls within the Top 30 of global Volcanogenic massive sulphide (VMS) deposits and was historically mined between the 1970’s and 1990’s producing about 1 Mt of zinc and 430 000 t of copper from 46.8 Mt of sulphide ore milled. With extensive infrastructure already in place, it is Orion Minerals’ intention to redevelop this historical mine through the implementation of a modern operating philosophy with safety and health improvements; improved environmental conditions, reduced pollution and contamination; improved energy efficiency and lower energy costs; productivity improvements; and operating cost reductions at the core of this philosophy.

Read more about mining in southern Africa What sets Orion Minerals apart from a copper perspective is
its relatively short lead time till first production compared with the very
long lead times of large copper mines which means that Orion could potentially
begin supplying copper as early as 2020 to the growing demand experienced from
the renewable energy industry. Meanwhile, the development of the project coincides well with high zinc demand. The current supply attrition not being replaced in time which bodes well for Orion Minerals. Comments from the judges “A real success story with world class deposits. Kakula mine
and the entire Kamoa-Kakula project is a credit to Ivanhoe’s outstanding
technical and management teams,” Ian Haddon “Truly world-class copper development set to be jewel in
Ivanhoe’s crown with highly skilled collaborative negotiation between Ivanhoe,
Chinese investors and DRC government. The mining world is watching to see the
phenomenal growth this will capture,” Tom Quinn
