The African Union, the Minerals Council South Africa, Mining Indaba, the International Council of Mining and Metals and South Africa’s Department of Mineral Resources, stood together to engage with the Alternative Mining Indaba. The Investing in African Mining Indaba was pleased to have the opportunity to engage with the Alternative Mining Indaba again this year, and to celebrate collective efforts to help support the growth of a more inclusive mining industry for all stakeholders. Simon Ford, Portfolio Director Mining Indaba says, “On behalf of Mining Indaba it is a great honour to receive the communique with our partners. "We take all issues facing the industry very seriously and we pledge our commitment to ensuring that key issues will always be discussed at the event. "Through an inclusive approach that involves every stakeholder we want to make a positive difference that provides a meaningful contribution to the continent of Africa.” "Over the years, sustainability has become an important part of our programme, ensuring that Indaba is an event that deals with community issues." Sustainable Development Day encourages the resolution of socio-economic challenges facing the industry, bringing together key members of civil society, NGOs, along with executives, government officials, academics and capital holders to discuss effective solutions for more sustainable and responsible extraction of natural resources.
