Goscor Earthmoving (GEM) Kathu, a multi-franchise branch of Goscor Industrial & Construction Equipment, continues to enjoy success with SANY excavators and front-end loaders in the mining industry in the Northern Cape. With manganese and iron ore being the main minerals mined here, the robust yet flexible SANY equipment is ideal for this harsh application in an extremely arduous operating environment, Melanie Uys from GEM Kathu comments.

The latest orders were completed in September and October 2019, with the equipment transported from Johannesburg to site. To date, WEGO Africa has eight SANY machines in its fleet, in addition to a Bobcat S450 skidsteer loader for general materials-handling applications. Commenting on the level of customer service and technical back-up that continues to give GEM Kathu a competitive edge, Uys explains that the latest excavators were fitted with pre-cleaners to prevent the air and oil filters from clogging up, which can have a detrimental impact on scheduled maintenance.
