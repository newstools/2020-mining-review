SENET is one of the leading project management and engineering firms in the field of mineral processing in Africa. For almost three decades, SENET has provided project management, multidisciplinary engineering, procurement, logistics management, and construction services to the mining, mineral processing, infrastructure and materials handling industries. SENET is committed to a policy of exceptional service and engineering excellence with a strong emphasis on quality, safety and environmental aspects. SENET has a well-established reputation for designing and completing medium to large projects on time, to specification and within budget. Most of these projects are in remote countries, consequently, SENET has grown to understand not only cross-border logistics, freighting and construction requirements, but also how to utilise and train the local labour workforce to the client’s benefit. Furthermore, SENET collaborates extensively with its clients to provide custom solutions that will mutually benefit both parties. SENET has attained its leading position through its innovative management approach and modest overhead structure, which allows for quick and effective decisions to fast-track its contracts. Coupled with its diverse in-house resources, SENET brings a professional and formidable capability to its clients’ projects. SENET’s experience encompasses every stage of the project life cycle, from scoping studies through to detailed design, construction and commissioning, training and structured project handover. SENET’s approach to projects is simple yet flexible, for example, services can be provided on a reimbursable basis, lump-sum turnkey contract or a hybrid version harnessing the best of both contracting philosophies.
