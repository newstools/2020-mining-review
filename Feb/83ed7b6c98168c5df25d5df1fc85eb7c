Date: 2-4 September 2020 Location: Perth, Western Australia Website Africa Down Under (ADU) continues to deliver the leading forum for Australia-Africa business relations. While the conference was introduced to raise awareness of Australia’s interests in African mining and energy, ADU has grown to become the largest African-focused mining event held outside the continent itself, and its importance continues to be reflected in the number of high profile attendees we welcome year after year to Perth – Australia’s gateway to Africa, and Australia’s undisputed mining capital.
