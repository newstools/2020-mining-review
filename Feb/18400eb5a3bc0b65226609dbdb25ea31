If you were not dropping terms such as Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), automation, and Industry 4.0 at this year’s Investing in African Mining Indaba, then you were not part of the IT-crowd at the event. Listening and talking to the experts at Mining Indaba, there is little doubt that the industry has had its Damascene moment when it comes to the digital future of mining. While there has been a spattering of discussion about 4IR previously, this year the topic was front and centre. However,
during my conversations with industry experts, I realised that while many
companies are saying they are adopting 4IR in their operations, few actually
know and understand the key drivers at the forefront of this mining revolution. And there is
absolutely nothing wrong with that. After all, one is not expected to be an
expert at everything. What is required however, is a basic understanding of the
various new technologies. In an article in the February issue of Mining Review Africa, Prof. Fred Cawood, director of the Wits Mining Institute states that employees need to have enough knowledge of these technological developments so that they can collaborate with the tech experts to ensure that a mine operates efficiently. How does one acquire such knowledge? To help you brush up your tech knowledge, we at Mining Review Africa spoke to leading experts. Learn the difference between AI and automation. Is the industry lagging behind in implementing 4IR methodologies and how is drone surveying is making mining safer and more profitable? Also, how do we teach the future workforce essential 4IR skills? Share the knowledge by tagging, liking and sharing these thought leadership videos with your network and be sure to keep coming back to miningreview.com to stay abreast of the latest tech developments. Also be sure to continue the conversation on social media platforms: Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. Until next time, Gerard Peter Senior Editor
