And, finally, we see a move in the “right” direction. Following the Benhaus case, there has been a lot of uncertainty regarding the ability of contract miners to access the benefits offered to mining companies conducting mining operations and whether such contract miners are permitted to claim the capital expenditure allowances offered to mining companies. READ MORE: Mboweni’s Budget Speech gets nod of approval from Minerals Council The tax treatment of contract miners has been a topic of debate for a while and was included in the Davis Tax Committee in its Second and Final Report on Hard-Rock Mining during 2017 (DTC Report). The
Annexure C proposals to the 2020/21 Budget now recommend that National Treasury
considers these challenges in further detail with possible amendments to the
capital expenditure regime contained in section 36(11) of the Income Tax
Act. Should we
see amendments in this regard, this will probably be the first notable
amendments to the mining tax provisions following the issuance of the DTC
Report. We are also
seeing a proposal that the ring-fencing provisions be reconsidered and possibly
restructured. Ring-fencing provisions generally apply to a mining company with
separate mines, in terms of which the tax position needs to be determined for
every mine with limited scope for offsetting of unredeemed capital expenditure
between mines. For
example, these provisions provide specifically that capital expenditure of one
mine may not be off-set against the taxable mining income from another
profitable mine. Possible relaxation of these provisions will be welcomed by
industry. By Adéle de Jager, executive for Tax at Bowmans
