TSX-listed Teranga
Gold Corporation has announced strong results from its ongoing drilling
programme at Golden Hill, located within the central part of the Houndé
Greenstone Belt in Burkina Faso. Burkina Faso – Houndé is a highly mineralized gold region that hosts three operating gold mines in southwest Burkina Faso, West Africa. Golden Hill, which is 100% owned by Teranga, is an advanced-stage exploration project that has delivered multiple high-grade gold discoveries over the last two years. The 20 000 m drilled as part of the current 27,000 m programme
have returned high-grade gold intercepts from near surface to depth at several
existing targets and encouraging gold grades in numerous step-out holes. The
campaign has also uncovered a new discovery: The Ma Jonction prospect, located
between Ma Main and Ma North. Read: Teranga Gold exceeds expectations Ma Jonction’s highlights include: • 8 m @ 6.40 g/t gold, including 1 m @ 15.49 and 3 m @ 10.09
g/t gold from10 m DHD (GHDD-574) • 3 m @ 44.11 g/t gold (uncut) from 33 m DHD (GHDD-572) (see
Table 1 in Appendix A for uncut and cut grade intervals for GHDD-572) “We are excited about the results we are seeing from the current drill programme, which is intended to increase resources as we move the project through a preliminary economic assessment and into feasibility,” stated Paul Chawrun, CEO. “In addition to another high-grade, near-surface discovery, the drill results reported today demonstrate positive continuity, grade, width and extended mineralisation in several zones. "Based on these results, we remain on track to update the initial resource estimate we published in February 2019 and apply for a mine license in the third quarter of this year.”
