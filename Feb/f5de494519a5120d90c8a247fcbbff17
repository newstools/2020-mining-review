Ahead of South Africa’s State of the Nation Address and the annual National Budget speech, the Minerals Council is urging President Ramaphosa to set the required direction on the way forward in decisively addressing the country’s myriad challenges. "South Africa cannot afford otherwise. It has to be Action, Action and Action," says Minerals Council CEO Baxter, adding that these Parliamentary events are going to provide powerful signals on whether South Africa is serious about addressing the economic and governance crises facing the country. The South African economy is in an unprecedented economic crisis, and in the longest economic downswing since 1945. In this, the most significant State of the Nation Address (SONA) since the dawn of democracy, the Minerals Council calls on President Ramaphosa to signal clear direction and action on critical issues.

South Africa is serious about addressing the economic and governance crises
facing the country. The
South African economy is in an unprecedented economic crisis, and in the
longest economic downswing since 1945. In this, the most significant State of
the Nation Address (SONA) since the dawn of democracy, the Minerals Council
calls on President Ramaphosa to signal clear direction and action on critical
issues. While
the Minerals Council understands that the President is being buffeted by a
variety of perspectives from a range of constituencies, it is urging that the
President use his powers of persuasion to impress upon all citizens the
seriousness of the situation and, where appropriate, the need for radical
measures to repair the damage done to South Africa since 2009 and to create a
new foundation for growth and development.” The Minerals Council is looking for signals in the SONA from President Ramaphosa around critical action and decisions to turn State-owned enterprises (SOEs) around, or dispose of them where there is no strategic reason for their continued state ownership.

way to a conservative 2020 National Budget, including the reigning in of public
service wages and wasteful expenditure. “There should be no more bailouts of any SOEs unless strict
conditions are set that would remedy governance and efficiency shortcomings,”
says Baxter. Baxter further said that while it would be improper
for the President to interfere in the work of the National Prosecutions
Authority (NPA), it is critical that he signal that government, like most
citizens, is anxious to see the prosecutions being brought against not only all
those involved in state capture, but also the private sector leaders involved
in high profile instances of alleged fraud. “It is unnecessary to wait for the Zondo
Commission to complete its work. To empower the NPA to move rapidly, the
President should direct the Finance Minister to allocate an extra R1 billion to
the office of the National Director of Public Prosecutions to prosecute these
cases,” he says. Moreover, as part of a growth strategy and
re-establishing confidence, the President needs to indicate that government is
to allow private concessions in key areas of economic infrastructure, such as
electricity, rail and ports – including, of course, self-power generation – and
materially reducing red-tape on business is required. In light of the unprecedented deterioration in the security situation facing the mining sector, the Minerals Council also looks forward to hearing about specific measures to establish a specialised mining police task force to tackle the serious crime affecting the mining sector.
