He adds: “Since the majority of vibration
monitoring and analysis tools available on the market today are primarily focused
on bearing condition, we have gone one step further in our range of condition-based
monitoring and analysis equipment to include tools for the monitoring and analysis
of the complete vibrating machine, as opposed to only focusing on the bearings
of the exciters in the vibrating machine. Becoming digitally savvy In line with the global move toward digital transformation and innovation and in response to the burgeoning Fourth Industrial Revolution, Schenk Process Africa has invested in the latest communication protocol to allow data to be collected and used in a more meaningful way, such as the analysis of machine trends to help better understand the available useful life of vibrating machines.” “Further to the monitoring and communication of
vibrating machine data, our vast experience in vibrating screen performance
allows us to analyse and interpret this data in such a way that the customer is
able to have better visibility of process performance as we as of the vibrating
screen condition at any given time and any maintenance or repair requirements,”
says Kempen. In a bid to optimise processes and results for
its customer with its state-of-the-art solutions to the many process challenges
in the mining industry, Schenck Process Africa has also upgraded its range of
weighing controllers to include the latest software and hardware available on
the market. Due to the growing scarcity of trained and experience operational and maintenance staff, coupled with the advances in technology, Schenck Process Africa encourages its mining industry clients to embrace and successfully combine the technologies offered by suppliers with their internal data acquisition and processing systems.
