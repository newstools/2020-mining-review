Comments from the judges “In wake of safety regression in SA

Mining.  Zero Harm initiatives bring
together CEOs of member companies to address top-down,” Tom Quinn “I like this one because it is an industry wide initiative led by senior management and has the potential to reach more people in the industry,” Jim Pooley
