Lulo diamonds purchased by Safdico are placed into the cutting and polishing
partnership. Once procurement and manufacturing costs are deducted, the profits
generated beyond the mine gate from the sale of the resultant polished diamonds
are shared equally between Sociedade Mineira Do Lulo and Safdico. To
date, Safdico has purchased approximately 4 900 carats of run of mine rough diamonds
from Sociedade Mineira Do Lulo under this commercial partnership. Sociedade
Mineira Do Lulo is due its first share of the partnership profits from
Safdico this quarter (Q1 2020). This new Lulo revenue stream represents another key milestone for Lucapa’s value-adding strategy. READ MORE: Record diamond production for Lucapa The
new revenues streams come as SML completes a self-funded US$12 million capital
investment programme designed to expand total group production to >60 000
carats in 2020 (on a 100% basis). This production increase, coupled with the new revenue streams generated from the cutting and polishing agreement with Safdico, will enable Sociedade Mineira Do Lulo to generate higher returns for its partners and make more regular loan repayments to Lucapa.
