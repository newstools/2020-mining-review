the full year to 31 December 2019, the company’s production result of 384,731 oz
comprised 243,058 oz from Syama, 87,187 oz from Mako, and 54,486 oz from
Ravenswood. At
Syama, the oxide circuit produced 180,534 oz and the Syama sulphide circuit
produced 62,524 oz. Syama
sulphide production is expected to accelerate rapidly in the current quarter
and be a strong performer for Resolute in the 2020 financial year (FY20). The
Syama roaster is now fully operational and operating at nameplate capacity. More
than 400,000 tonnes of underground ore has been stockpiled and is available for
processing. The
Syama underground autonomous fleet is commissioned and Resolute is well
positioned to deliver on Syama’s potential in 2020. Total
cash, bullion and listed investments as at 31 December 2019 was US$127 million. Resolute’s
total debt was US$394 million which is net of in-country receivables of US$34
million. The
company’s net debt position as at 31 December 2019 was US$267 million. Production
cost information for the December 2019 Quarter, including the preliminary
unaudited FY19 AISC results, are currently being prepared. It
is expected that this information, along with FY20 production, AISC, and
capital and exploration expenditure guidance, will be released on 13 January
2020. MD and CEO, John Welborn, is pleased that the company had delivered a FY19 production result within 4% of annual guidance despite the Syama roaster being offline for the majority of the December 2019 Quarter. “Syama
sulphide production fell well short of our expectations in both the September
and December quarters. Our operating and project teams have worked hard to
offset lost production with strong performance from our other operating assets. “The
repairs to the Syama roaster are now complete and the sulphide circuit is ready
for a strong performance in 2020. In addition to managing the challenge of the
Syama roaster repairs, we have made significant progress in delivering on our
strategy during 2019. “We
have now fully commissioned the Syama Underground Mine, refurbished the Syama
sulphide circuit, acquired the Mako Gold Mine on highly value accretive terms,
generated excellent exploration success at Tabakoroni, completed Stage 1 of the
Ravenswood Expansion Project, and significantly progressed the strategic review
of Bibiani. “With a pipeline of growth opportunities and Syama positioned to deliver on its potential, I am highly optimistic for 2020”.
