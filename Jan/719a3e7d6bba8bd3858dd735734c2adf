However, with production of Massawa’s free-milling ore expected to commence at Sabodala’s existing carbon-in-leach plant in the second half of this year, 2020 production is expected to increase beyond the previously anticipated range. Within six months of closing the Massawa acquisition, Teranga plans to complete a pre-feasibility study highlighting updated production and costs for the integrated Sabodala-Massawa complex.
