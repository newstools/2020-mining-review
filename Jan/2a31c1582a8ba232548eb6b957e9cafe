Rio Tinto has donated a further A$750 000 to the Red Cross’ disaster relief and recovery efforts that are supporting people affected by Australia’s bushfire crisis. This is in
addition to the A$250 000 that Rio Tinto donated to the Red Cross in November
2019, bringing the company’s total donation to A$1 million. The funds will
be used to help Red Cross emergency service teams provide vital support to
impacted communities including: • safe places
to take shelter; • psychological
first aid to reduce trauma; • information
and practical assistance through the time it can take to recover; and • longer-term
recovery programmes in affected communities. Since November 2019, hundreds of Red Cross emergency personnel – mostly volunteers – have manned relief and evacuation centres in bushfire impacted communities around the country.
