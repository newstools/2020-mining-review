a very successful year for exploration in 2019, B2Gold is planning another year
of aggressive exploration in 2020 with a budget of approximately $51 million Based
on current assumptions, including a gold price of $1,500 per oz, the Company
expects to generate cashflows from operating activities of approximately $700
million in 2020 and to repay the remaining outstanding balance of its RCF of
$200 million during the year Consolidated
cash costs are projected to remain low for 2019 with cash operating costs
forecast to be at or below the lower end of the Company's $520 and $560 per oz

production outlook and cost guidance In 2020, B2Gold remains well positioned for continued strong operational and financial performance with consolidated gold production forecast to be in the range of between 955,000 and 1,005,000 oz. Including
the Company's 34% share of attributable ounces projected from Calibre's El
Limon and La Libertad mines, the Company's total gold production is expected to
be between 1,000,000 and 1,055,000 oz in 2020. Production in 2020 is anticipated to be marginally weighted towards the second half of the year (52%). With higher production forecast for 2020, continued cost controls and the sale of the Company's higher-cost Nicaraguan mines completed, the Company's consolidated cash operating costs per ounce and AISC per ounce are both projected to further decrease in 2020. The
Company's consolidated cash operating costs are forecast to decrease
significantly in 2020 and be between $415 and $455 per oz, approximately 19%
lower than the Company's 2019 guidance range. The Company's consolidated AISC are forecast to be between $780 and $820 per ounce, approximately 6% lower than the Company's 2019 guidance range.
