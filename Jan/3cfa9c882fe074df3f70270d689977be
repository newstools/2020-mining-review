“As a result of the
strong operational performance, we generated over $47 million of free cashflow
before growth expenditures in the second half of the year,” says President and
CEO, John Dorward. “Yaramoko had an
exceptional last quarter with record production and plant throughput averaging
over 30% of nameplate capacity. “This led to full year production being within 2% of the low end of production guidance mainly due to the timing of mining high grade stopes in December.” said John Dorward, President and CEO of Roxgold.

continues to pursue additional growth opportunities through our ongoing organic
exploration programs while keeping our eyes open for further external opportunities.” In 2019, the Yaramoko
gold mine produced 479,929 tonnes at 8.90 g/t Au with stoping tonnes increasing
throughout the year. Annual processing
throughput was 466,157 tonnes at 9.5 g/t Au with overall plant availability of
96%. Throughput levels
increased quarter over quarter during the year, driven by the additional ore
feed from Bagassi South, as well as ongoing optimization and improved operating
performance in the plant. On a quarterly basis, at the 55 Zone, 97,775 tonnes of ore were mined at 10.41 grams per tonne (“g/t Au”) and 1,568 metres (“m”) of development was completed. Read more about mining in West Africa Approximately 71% of the
ore mined at 55 Zone came from stoping activities with five open stopes
available at the end of the quarter. Decline development in
the 55 Zone reached the 4774 level, approximately 544 metres below surface,
with ore development occurring on the 4811 and 4828 levels. At Bagassi South, 42,807
tonnes of ore were mined at 5.5 g/t Au and 1,584 metres of development were
completed. Grade was lower than planned due to the timing of stoping sequences
and delayed access to higher grade stopes. Development ore
contributed approximately 50% of the ore mined while stoping activities have
increased with three open stopes available at the end of the quarter. The development of the
decline reached the 5095 level and stoping operations have commenced on the
5180 and 5146 levels. During the fourth
quarter, the plant processed a record 131,439 tonnes at an average head grade
of 9.8 g/t Au. Plant availability was 98.7% and overall recovery remained high
at 98.3%. With an average daily
throughput of 1,429 tpd, the Yaramoko plant has continued to outperform,
exceeding the nameplate capacity of 1,100 tpd by approximately 30% in the
quarter. During the second half of
the year, Roxgold generated strong free cashflow (before growth spend) of over
$47 million increasing its cash balance from $19.4 million to approximately
$41.8 million as of December 31, 2019. Roxgold finished the year with a net cash position of over $16 million (cash balance of approximately $41.8 million and long-term debt face value balance of $25.6 million).
