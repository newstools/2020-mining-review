Lucara Diamond Corp has entered into a collaboration with luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton and Antwerp-based diamond manufacturer HB Company, to manufacture its historic, record setting, 1 758 carat Sewelô diamond recovered from its 100% owned Karowe diamond mine in Botswana in April 2019. Sewelô, which means "rare find" in Setswana, is the second, +1 000 carat diamond recovered from Karowe in four years and the largest ever recovered in Botswana.

has been characterised as near gem of variable quality, with recent analysis
confirming that it also includes domains of higher-quality white gem. Lucara
believes that the full potential of this special stone will only be revealed
once polished. The purpose of this unprecedented collaboration between a miner,
a cutting edge manufacturer and a large luxury brand will be the planning,
cutting and polishing of a collection of diamonds from Sewelô. Lucara will
receive an up front non-material payment for the Sewelô and retain a 50%
interest in the individual polished diamonds that result. Further, 5% of all of the retail sales proceeds generated from this historic collection will be invested directly back into Botswana on community-based initiatives undertaken by Lucara.
