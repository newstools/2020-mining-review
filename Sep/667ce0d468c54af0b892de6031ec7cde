Lucapa MD Stephen Wetherall comments: “SML has delivered strong operational performances soon after recommencing operations following the lockdown. “Although the average diamond size in this sale parcel was smaller than average, the encouraging signals being seen in the industry currently have led to upward price movements across a number of diamond categories. “That, together with the record recoveries from the leziria areas suggests Lulo should have a much improved second half in 2020”.
