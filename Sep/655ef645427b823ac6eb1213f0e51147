In an underground mining environment, solutions that are easy to manoeuvre are key. SEW-Eurodrive, specialists in drive and control technologies, offers the most compact bell-housing solution currently available on the market. Typically used for underground conveyors with limited height restraints, SEW-Eurodrive’s purpose built bell-housing solution can also be utilised for overland conveyors, in-plant conveyors and on stacker or reclaimer drives. The unique feature of the solution lies in the fact that there is less likelihood that misalignment will occur given that the alignment between the gearbox and motor use a flanged concept. This means that it won’t require any re-alignment even after transportation and installation. The fixed design is achieved by making use of a solid flange structure between the motor and the gearbox, with machined locating points for the gearbox and the motor. The skid allows the gearbox to be dragged underground to the installation point. Another benefit of SEW-Eurodrive’s bell-housing solution is that it is locally manufactured and the gearbox in turn, is locally assembled using available stock, awarding service ability anywhere in the world. It is suitable for all environments and conveying needs including chrome, platinum and coal mining. The company recently supplied six 110 kilowatt motors with X series to a coal mine in Mpumalanga, while other coal mines in the same province have been supplied with numerous complete units ranging from 110-200 kilowatt motor powers. SEW-Eurodrive offers a comprehensive range of adaptable engineering solution to industry for the entire value chain.
