CDE Global has been identifying ways to tailor its wet minerals processing equipment into bespoke solutions that can help the broader mining industry unlock resources that have previously been seen as “not worth the squeeze”. The company proved this in Australia where it helped bring an Australian iron ore miner back from the brink of closure through the innovative use of its technology. Submit a nomination for the 2021 edition of Mining Elites in Africa CDE designed, manufactured and installed a turnkey iron ore waste beneficiation system across two mining sites, located in the remote Middleback Ranges of South Australia. The iron ore waste beneficiation solution was able to wash, separate and gravity beneficiate about 17 Mt of low grade overburden iron ore that was stockpiled in waste dumps into a high-grade saleable product with a 63% iron content – upgraded from an average low-grade grade of between 45% and 50% iron content in the waste dumps which were accumulated over the operation’s life. “The minerals processing solution included a range of equipment from the CDE mine and quarry product portfolio, including the M-Series modular washing plant, the AggMax modular logwasher; the EvoWash fine washing plant; the AquaCycle thickener as well its patented H-line horizontal screens with Infinity screening technology. This solution proved to be an effective way to extract the best possible value from material that has already been mined as a means to add to a company’s bottom line. Moreover, CDE entered into a partnership with Consulmet to supply beneficial technologies and equipment that will significantly enhance the performance of XRTs for alluvial diamond mines and start-up kimberlite mines, providing Consulme with a solution to remain competitive in an environment which is seeing traditional equipment suppliers create their own process capabilities. The partnership was signed after Consulmet installed CDE’s staple high-tech scrubbing and attrition system, the AggMax modular logwasher, at the front of the XRT.  Designed as the feed preparation stage for the XRT, it can effectively remove non-diamond organic material.
