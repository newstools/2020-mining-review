As we move towards a greener economy, consumers are demanding that products are sourced in an ethical and responsible way. This in turn is driving the way manufacturers source mined materials. It is therefore commendable that leading EV manufacturer Tesla this week joined the Fair Cobalt Alliance (FCA), an initiative that was recently launched to support and improve artisanal and small-scale miners (ASM) operations in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Listen: Formalising artisanal mining in the DRC The FCA will work with the DRC government and civil society partners to tackle problems in the cobalt supply chain linked to ASMs, such as poor working conditions and child labour, and build a source of responsible cobalt from the ASM sector. In addition to Tesla and a host of leading international manufacturers and suppliers, mining major Glencore has also thrown its weight behind the initiative. More than two-thirds of the worldâ€™s cobalt supply comes from the DRC with a significant portion extracted by ASM. More importantly, cobalt ASM is a source of direct employment for more than 100 000 people in the country. Therefore, it is encouraging to see that global companies are committed to improving the economic, social and working conditions for many mining communities in the cobalt supply chain.
