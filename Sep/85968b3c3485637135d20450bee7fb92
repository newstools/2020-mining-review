BlueRock Executive Chairman, Mike Houston, says, “Our diamonds remain attractive to buyers even in what continues to be an uncertain market. “Similar to the sale announced in June 2020, this was a private sale conducted through a sales agent in South Africa. We are pleased with the price achieved which is above our internal budget and a 14% increase over the price achieved in June 2020.

As soon as this is completed, we will commence exports which gives us the flexibility of bridge financing our inventory, if required. Until then we have the option of selling our diamonds locally at a price which allows us to operate profitably.”
