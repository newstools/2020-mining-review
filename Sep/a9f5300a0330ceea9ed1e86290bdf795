Nordgold has started replatforming its mine planning IT systems to Deswik. The move follows a successful three-month test period and will see the Company integrating its operating environment from the numerous software applications currently in use. Deswik provides specialist solutions spanning software, consulting, and training. To date, Nordgold has implemented strategic mine planning, pit design, load and haul simulation, survey modules, and is also considering using Deswik’s drill hole optimizer module.

Throughout the test period, the Deswik software has been adopted by the Company’s head office, the Gross and Tabornoe open pit mines in Eastern Siberia, the Suzdal underground mine in Kazakhstan, and the Lefa mine in Guinea.

Louw Smith, Nordgold’s COO, comments: “At Nordgold we pride ourselves on knowledge sharing and collaboration across the business, despite the differences between our individual operations. “The Deswik platform is a perfect fit as it caters for both underground and open pit mines, which was crucial for our diversified business. “We have been particularly encouraged by the software’s ability to circumvent our legacy systems’ constraints, while still supporting older data formats for backwards compatibility. “As the implementation phase has proven, Deswik’s software allows for optimisation of resources to generate guidance reserve shapes, pit design, scheduling of designs, and optimising schedules. “Moreover, schedules can be used to generate equipment simulation to investigate the effectiveness of mining fleet and assist in optimising both operating and capital expense allocation.”
