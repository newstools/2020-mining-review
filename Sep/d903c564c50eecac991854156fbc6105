Grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change and the courage to change the things I can. This is a verse from the widely-known Serenity Prayer; its meaning is self-explanatory. Now, while many of us wish that we could restart 2020, the reality is that the effects of COVID-19 on the mining industry will be felt for a long time to come.

In the latest episode of our podcast series, Deep Insights, Wessel Badenhorst, partner at Hogan Lovells Johannesburg, paints a picture of the South African mining industry post-Covid-19 pandemic. He touches on salient points such as eradicating corruption, adopting new technologies and regulatory frameworks â€“ all of which can be changed through collaboration between government, mining companies and labour unions.
