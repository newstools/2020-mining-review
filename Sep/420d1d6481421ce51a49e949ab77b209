Join Africa Mining Forum and Mining Review Africa for the third episode in a series of expert-led Webinars to help guide your African mining investment decisions. Following on from the ‘Africa Mining Tour’ journey we started in the East and West African regions, AMF’s third event in the series takes a close look at key strategic regions in Southern Africa – South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe – looking at the junior market and how they are faring amidst the pandemic, how investment decisions have changed and influenced their businesses, and what plans are in play for the short, medium and long-term future. While COVID-19 has significantly changed operating models, as well as investors’ approaches and decision-making, there are still opportunities for the junior sector in these territories, which will support the recovery of the broader mining industry. Join Africa Mining Forum and Mining Review Africa for a webinar that will dissect the current and future impact of COVID-19 in South Africa, Botswana and Zimbabwe, and how the resilience of the mining sector has the power to overcome this challenge, like many others that have come before and are still to come.
