B2Gold has successfully commissioned the mill expansion at its Mali-based Fekola gold mine to 7.5 Mtpa, approximately one month ahead of the scheduled completion date of 30 September 2020. This includes completion of all major construction activities associated with the Fekola mill expansion, as well as successful execution of a process performance test to compare with design expectations. Four days after start-up, a five-day mill performance test was conducted from 26 – 30 August. The results of the performance test exceeded design in throughput, gold recovery, grind and availability over the five-day day period. The minor, outstanding construction work is expected to be completed by mid-September 2020.
