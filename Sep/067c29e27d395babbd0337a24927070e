Minopex, a DRA Global Group company, is pleased to announced the recovery of two large high-quality diamonds at the Letšeng Diamond Mine in Lesotho, where we manage the plant operations. On the 18th of August 2020, a beautiful 442-carat gem quality stone was recovered, making it the first diamond of over 400 carats to be recovered at Letšeng since the 910-carat “Lesotho Legend” in January 2018. The second significant recovery, a 233ct gem quality stone, was on the 31st of August 2020. Both recoveries were made safely and under challenging circumstances brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic. “I once again thank each and every one of you for your huge contribution to the success of the mine” said COO of Letšeng Diamonds, Jeremy Taylor.
