Submit a nomination for the 2021 edition of Mining Elites in Africa Traditional mine surveys comprised a manned aircraft flying over a mine twice a month. That gave mine operator 24 data collection point a year. In addition, because everything was paper based, it would take up to 10 days for surveyors to provide this data to mines. On the other hand, Rocketmine drones, operated by Civil Aviation Authority licensed pilots, use photography and mapping software that enable them to collect up to 200 data points a month – the information is available on the same day as a flight. So whether a mine is in the planning or operational stage, the company ensures that its clients are able to meet their deadlines and productivity targets. Today, it services mines throughout the continent including Nigeria, Namibia and Ghana and has a client base that includes Exxaro, Rio Tinto and South32.
