TSX-listed Trigon Metals has announced a staggering 456% increase in the total mineral resources reported at its Kombat copper project in Namibia. Namibia – Trigon Metals this week announced that the 7.0 million tonnes, as at February 28, 2018 has now increased to 39.1 million tonnes (including inferred resources). A total of 3,758 additional mineralized underground drill holes have been incorporated outside of the holes utilized in the 2018 Mineral Resource database, leading to a 152% increase in the volume of the resource shell and 3D confirmation of ore not removed by historic mining. The previous total Inferred and Indicated Mineral Resource of 7 million tonnes represented between 18% of the pre-existing geological model used for resource reporting, with the remaining 82% of the tonnage based on drill holes not previously included.  Additional work was undertaken including improvement of the level of accuracy of depletions in the underground areas. The previous 2018 Mineral Resource estimate for the open pit areas – Kombat and Gross Otavi – comprised an indicated mineral resource of 1.529 million tonnes grading 1.14% copper, 0.72% lead and 2.88 g/t silver, and an inferred mineral resource of 1.582 million tonnes grading 1.40% copper, 1.79% lead and 2.17 g/t silver, at a cut-off grade of 0.6% copper equivalent for Kombat and 0.77% for Gross Otavi. Watch: Analysis: Mining in Namibia A significant copper mine The Kombat Mine is one of the most significant copper mines in Namibia. It originally commenced mining in 1962 and operated until 2008, producing 12.46 million tonnes of ore grading 2.6% Cu over this period. The Kombat Mine’s extensive infrastructure includes an 800 m shaft, which was completed in 2006, two other vertical shafts, three decline shafts with ramp systems, extensive underground workings, mine buildings, a tailings facility, a mill and concentrator. Trigon Metals (formerly Kombat Copper) acquired 80% of the mine and related assets in 2012.
