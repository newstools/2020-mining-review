While the industry is embracing the ideas that this technology has to offer, it is yet to fully understand what it truly means and how to incorporate it. While the world looks to enter a new AI era over the coming decades, Mining Review Africa and Africa Mining Forum are hosting a webinar that looks to outline what mining companies can do over the next five years to establish the building blocks necessary to deliver a sustainable AI future. Production uptime, employment, safety and data management are key words linked to AI, but how can the industry achieve more immediate results when investing in technology to do so?
