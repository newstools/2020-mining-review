Minerals sands miner Kenmare Resources, operator of the Moma titanium minerals mine in northern Mozambique, has successfully and safely relocated the dredge, which forms part of the wet concentrator plant B mining operation. Read more: Relocation of Kenmare’s wet concentrator plant underway Kenmare has three development projects that together have the objective of increasing annual ilmenite production to 1.2 Mt (plus co-products) on a sustainable basis from 2021, with the move of WCP B to the high grade Pilivili ore zone being the final project. The increased production is expected to significantly lower cash operating costs to between US$125 and US$135/t (in 2020 real terms). Consequently, from 2021 the group expects to be positioned in the first quartile of the industry revenue to cost (or margin) curve, supporting stronger free cash flow generation and providing for increased shareholder returns.

The move was undertaken using platform vehicles called self-propelled modular transporters (SPMTs) by specialist heavy lifting and transport contractor Mammoet. Following the successful relocation of the dredge, the SPMTs are returning to Namalope to transport the WCP along the same route. The WCP is expected to begin relocation next week. “Completing the relocation of WCP B’s dredge safely and within the expected timeframe is an important milestone for the project,” says Kenmare Resources MD Michael Carvill. “The 23 km purpose-built road performed well and we are confident in its ability to support the WCP in the coming days. We look forward to providing another update when the relocation and safe offloading of WCP B has been achieved,” he adds. For more information view this animation
