Mali Lithium executive chairman, Dr Alistair Cowden, commented: “We are delighted with the support from institutional and sophisticated investors and in turn the strong endorsement of the Morila Gold Mine acquisition. We welcome our new shareholders and are very appreciative of the support that our existing shareholders continue to provide. “We are particularly pleased to welcome Resolute Mining Limited as a shareholder. The opportunity to develop a strategic partnership with Resolute in Mali will be investigated in the coming months. The acquisition of Morila represents a watershed moment for the Company. In becoming a gold producer with a significant Mineral Resource base, we intend to build shareholder value through near term production growth and increasing mine life.
