AIM-listed Armadale Capital  has taken another crucial step to progress its 100%-owned Mahenge graphite in Tanzania. Tanzania – Armadale Capital has continued to focus on fast tracking Mahenge to production. The company has been engaging with potential international manufacturing and construction companies as to their suitability and capability to complete the graphite processing plant. A group of international companies have been short-listed with final selection imminent, following which work will commence on the (Front End Engineering Design) FEED component. The first stage of the work will be for the selected EPCM to complete a metallurgical test programme to enable the detailed selection of the processing plant equipment. Metallurgical testing has confirmed that Mahenge can produce high quality, high purity graphite, with conventional technology achieving consistent purity of above 97% TGC, some of the highest grades in the sector, with identified target markets; a large proportion of concentrates in the medium size fractions are confirmed to be ideally suited to the battery market whilst coarser grind sizes can retain a larger proportion of larger flake sizes, suited to the expandable and graphite foil markets.

Appointing our chosen EPCM will mark the commencement of the next preparatory phase of mine construction and take us another step closer to production. “With project financing, a mining licence and commencement of mine construction all imminent, Mahenge, and indeed Armadale, is on the cusp of transformation.  Ultimately, Mahenge’s value potential is clear, and it is our responsibility and focus to convert this into meaningful returns for our stakeholders. This is truly an exciting time of development,” he concluded.
