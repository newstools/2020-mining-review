In partnership with our media partner, Mining Review Africa, our programme helps to address these uncertainties.” “What COVID-19 has made clear, is that there has never been a more critical time to work together to support our employees and local communities,” explains William Witham, CEO of AAMEG, the Australia-Africa Minerals & Energy Group, a returning supporting association and speaker. “Looking ahead, collaboration between government, civil society and the private sector will play an important role in helping African economies and supply chains rebuild.
