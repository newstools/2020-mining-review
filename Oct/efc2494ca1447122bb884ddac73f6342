VBKOM Consulting and AIKO Project Consulting, joined forces to create a Northern Cape based 51% black youth -owned mining and engineering consulting services company. The new venture is called ‘Sehlare Sa Meetlwa’ – or ‘Diverse and deeply rooted thorn tree’. The partnership symbolises the rich cultural diversity of the mining industry, with a strongly rooted history of economic growth and cultural collaboration with an embedded common goal of service delivery and client satisfaction. The 2018 Mining Charter focusses on local economic growth and sustainability and all mining houses are motivated to support local businesses.

Anyone starting a new business needs a solid business plan, but also most likely a mentor to help guide you on your path to success. Sehlare Sa Meetlwa’s focus is to provide that support and mentorship to small businesses by uniquely measuring their level of maturity as an organization and creating a unique road map to maturity. VBKOM provides small businesses with tangible mentorship to ensure maturity growth of their organization. Sehlare Sa Meetlwa’s “Why” is strongly focused on client satisfaction with our key value being “Our Client victories and satisfaction is our greatest reward”. VBKOM believes in successful mentorship delivery in which too may contribute greatly to realizing local economic growth and sustainability. Growing small businesses within local communities helps it to reduce the negative statistics so that all may strive for greater economic success and sustainable growth for small business owners.
