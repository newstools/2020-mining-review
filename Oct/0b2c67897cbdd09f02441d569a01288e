Date: 16-19 November 2020 Location: Digital Event Website The 2nd International Conference on High-Performance Mining aims to inspire change in the global mining industry by presenting selected benchmark projects that provide insights how the mine of the future can be realised. International experts, among them Canadian presenters from Vale, Eldorado Gold, Nuveau Monde Graphite, and Inspire Resources, but also leaders from Anglo American and Antamina, and industry leaders such as George Hemingway from the Stratalis Group are featured in the program. The sessions of the conference are centered around the following core themes: The Autonomous Mine, the Green Mine, and the Peopleâ€™s Mine, representing the vision for the mine of the future: digitally integrated and connected, autonomous, productive and profitable, safe and socially accepted with minimum environmental impact. The South America Day presents leading projects and innovations from a dynamic mining region and provides insights into the digitalisation roadmap of Chile and Peru. Since the Conference has traditionally been a platform to meet and form new bonds and partnerships, we take advantage of the latest technological tools to provide facilitated and moderated networking opportunities and engaging side-events to enable the attendees to get into contact with each other.
