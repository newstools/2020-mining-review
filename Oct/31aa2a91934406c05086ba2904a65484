KEFI Gold and Copper has announced that it has assembled the full consortium and set the conditional terms for the independently reviewed development funding package of c.US$221 million for the Company’s flagship Tulu Kapi Gold Project. Commenting, Harry Anagnostaras-Adams, Executive Chairman of KEFI, says: “I am delighted that we continue to attract strong African experienced participants in our Tulu Kapi funding structure in a manner that enables KEFI and its Government Partners to increase their beneficial ownership, for KEFI to c.65% of the Tula Kapi Project.
