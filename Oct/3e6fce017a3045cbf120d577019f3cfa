Exxaro Resources, based on a strategic review of its portfolio of assets, previously concluded that zinc mining was not strategically aligned to the groupâ€™s long-term objectives. Exxaro therefore initiated a sales process for the disposal of its 24.4% interest in Black Mountain Mining. Recent media reports suggested that the sales process has now been finalised. Exxaro wishes to clarify that negotiations are at an advanced stage, but that no transaction has been concluded to date and Exxaro will apprise the market as soon as a transaction has been concluded.
