Olamilekan Adegbite, Minister of Mines and Steel Development believes that the current economic challenges brought about by COVID-19 is an opportunity for the country to build a more resilient and diversified economy. To that end, his department is hard at work to provide an investor-friendly ecosystem for the rapid development of the sector.
