Shanta Gold has announced the beginning of construction work together with updated Project Economics for the Singida Gold Mining Project in central Tanzania. “The Singida project has very attractive economics for Shanta with considerable upside through potential conversion of mineral resources currently outside of the reserve-based mine plan,” says Shanta Gold CEO, Eric Zurrin.
