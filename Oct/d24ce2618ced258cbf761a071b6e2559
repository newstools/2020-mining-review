As the contribution of women to the energy sector has increased significantly in the last 10 years, the focus on how energy access is changing women’s lives across the continent is one of the cornerstones of the Digital Energy Festival for Africa, which opens on Tuesday 20 October and runs until 26 November. The festival will give a platform to female entrepreneurs and focus on gender as an economic enabler for African communities and individuals seeking equality. “Throughout the festival we will learn from incredible leaders that have risen to powerful positions, not because of their gender, but because they’re the best leaders of our time. They’re already inspiring so many other women and we have seen that reflected across the festival – especially in the AFSIA Solar Awards which has received a majority of entries from women-led and owned African businesses.” – Shiddika Mohamed, group director, EnergyNet, organisers of Africa Energy Forum. The Digital Energy Festival will see four of Clarion Events’ leading energy brands Africa Energy Forum, African Utility Week & POWERGEN Africa and the Oil & Gas Council’s Africa Assembly and the leading energy journal ESI Africa jointly host six weeks of compelling content. “Over the past decade, I’ve had the privilege of connecting with highly skilled women in the various power and energy fields, from geothermal engineers to the CEOs of private and public sector companies. The common denominator that always appears is the importance of having family support and industry mentors along your career path. Therefore, I’m delighted that ESI Africa is part of the Digital Energy Festival, and we will feature fireside chats with women who are mentors in their own right and we will showcase our GenderLens series of conversations.” – Nicolette Pombo-van Zyl, editor, ESI Africa. Young women must be deliberate – This is the opinion of another well-known trailblazer in the African      energy sector, Ifeoma Malo, CEO of Clean Tech Hub and the Energy      Innovation Center in Abuja. She is part of African Utility Week &      POWERGEN Africa’s Women in Energy session on Monday, 23 Nov.
