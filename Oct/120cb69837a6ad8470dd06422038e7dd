BlueRock Executive Chairman, Mike Houston, states: “I am pleased to report a record quarter for three of our main KPIs: production, carats produced and grade. “Volumes have been strong even though we are still using our old plant; this bodes well for the future. The increase in grade to 4.51 cpht is particularly pleasing as it follows a period of low grade whilst we concentrated on creating the Main Pit; we are confident that we will be able to meet or exceed our long term guidance of between 4.0 cpht and 4.6 cpht.
