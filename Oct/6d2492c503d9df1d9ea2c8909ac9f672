Lucapa Diamond Company and its partner, the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho have announced an updated JORC classified Indicated and Inferred Diamond Resource estimate for the Mothae kimberlite diamond mine in Lesotho. A total JORC classified Indicated Resource has been estimated for 9.2 Mt, containing ~280,000 carats of diamonds at a diamond grade of 3.10 cpht and an average un-escalated modelled diamond value of US$635 per carat. This Indicated Resource has been estimated to 75 m depth below the current pit floor in the South Lobe at a nominal 3 mm bottom cut-off size (BCOS).

This Inferred Resource has been estimated from below the Indicated Resource to 300 m below surface, at a nominal 3mm BCOS. Lucapa MD Stephen Wetherall comments: “The updated Mothae Resource is the result of significant work undertaken to increase the resource and classification at Mothae following almost 16 months of mining and treatment through the new commercial plant.” “The increase in tonnes and carats, the classification of 9.2 Mt or ~280,000 carats into indicated resource category at an estimated diamond value of US$635 per carat strongly supports an expansion in production at Mothae that the partners are considering.”
