The 2021 edition of Investing in African Mining Indaba has been cancelled due to the ongoing uncertainty caused by COVID-19. The event will now take place on 7-10 February 2022. For the last 27 years, Investing in African Mining Indaba has been about bringing the global mining community together and delivering world-class, face-to-face events. “Unfortunately, after discussions with our partners in South Africa and key stakeholders in the mining industry, we have made the difficult decision to cancel the 2021 edition of Mining Indaba,” explains Fred Noce, Director of Sales. “Bringing people together is at the heart of what we do at Mining Indaba. We remain confident that we could have delivered our event in February safely. “However, ongoing uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and international travel restrictions means that we can no longer be certain of delivering the event to the highest standard to which our audience is accustomed. “With the current restrictions for hosting events in South Africa preventing larger gatherings we believe the impact on our attendee ROI and ROTI would have been significant and was therefore an important contributing factor to the decision to cancel.”  Have you registered for Africa Mining Forum’s digital event?
