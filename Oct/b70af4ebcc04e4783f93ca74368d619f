Join Africa Mining Forum, together with Mining Review Africa, for the third episode in a series of expert-led webinars to help guide your African mining investment decisions. Following on from the ‘Africa Mining Tour’ journey we started in the East, West and Southern African regions, AMF’s fourth and last event in the 2020 series will dive into the significant potential that Angola holds in the minerals and metals industry as they are taking a sharp turn to diversify their oil-based economy. Angola is currently the world’s fifth-largest producer of diamonds with 60% of the country’s diamond resources not yet exploited, but it has a wealth of other mineral resources to take advantage of such as gold and copper. In the last 12 months, Angola’s government has been proactive in its efforts to attract private investment and launched a nationwide survey of Angola’s geology, which is one of the key initiatives in the quest to diversify the country’s economy. While COVID-19 has significantly changed operating models, as well as investors’ approaches and decision-making, there are growing opportunities for the junior sector in Angola. Join African Mining Forum and Mining Review Africa for a webinar that will discuss the impact of the pandemic on the short, medium and long term. We will also take a close look at how investment decisions have changed and influenced stakeholder businesses and what is currently being done to reinforce the attractiveness of the Angola’s mineral wealth. Join us for our Digital Event from 16 to 20 of November for 5 days of topical content, engagement and case studies gravitating around the African junior mining industry.
