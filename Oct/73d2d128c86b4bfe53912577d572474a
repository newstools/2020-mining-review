The Minerals Council South Africa is shocked to hear of the murder by shooting of mining community leader, Fikile Ntshangase, at her home in Northern KwaZulu-Natal on Thursday night. The Minerals Council has not had any links with Ms Ntshangase; her work has not, as far as the council is aware, involved any member companies; and it cannot be certain of the motives of her killers. However, it is inevitable that there would be suspicions that her murder was linked to her work related to mining developments in the area. The Minerals Council advocates engagement with civil society organisations, including groups representing communities in the vicinity of existing and proposed mining operations. It is understood that the social license to operate is critical for any such operation. Constructive and peaceful efforts by all stakeholders to consult over possible adverse impacts of mining should be part of such engagements. The Minerals Council extends its deepest condolences to the family and colleagues of Ms Ntshangase.
