TSX-listed White Metal Resources has initiated its 2020-21 exploration programme on the Taranis copper-silver located in north western Namibia. Namibia – The news follows after the company received approval for its exploration from the Ministry of Mines and Energy (MME) as well as permission to re-log and re-sample historical reverse circulation (RC) drill hole sample chips stored in a government warehouse in Tsumeb. In addition to the RC chip re-sampling programme, White Metals Resources is planning to complete a minimum 1 000 metre RC drilling programme, aimed largely at the historical Okohongo Cu-Ag deposit (confirmation and in-fill holes) and reconnaissance geological mapping and sampling over the property. Analysis: Mining in Namibia Project shows plenty of promise The primary objective of the 2020-21 exploration programme is to update historical mineral resources in the Okohongo deposit and complete a technical report and mineral resource estimate compliant with The National Instrument 43-101 (NI 43-101). Michael Stares, President and CEO stated, “I am very excited to see the start of our mineral exploration programme on the Taranis copper-silver project. Although the primary target is the historical Okohongo copper-silver deposit, we will be conducing reconnaissance work over the entire EPL, including follow up on a number of promising historical copper showings.”
