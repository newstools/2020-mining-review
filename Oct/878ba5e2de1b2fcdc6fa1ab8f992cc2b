Strict health and safety regulations in the mining industry mean that any liquid spills in workshop areas or elsewhere need to be cleaned quickly and effectively. This is where a completely natural, mineral product called Gunge Spunge is playing a major role. Produced by South African manufacturer Pratley, Gunge Spunge is the ideal product for cleaning up any liquid spills, including petrol, diesel, oil, sewage and other nuisance liquids.

In fact, many mines and municipal by-laws now prohibit their use. Gunge Spunge offers the ideal solution in that it is extremely effective, non-flammable and eco-friendly, explains Pratley Marketing Manager Eldon Kruger. Read more about safety Gunge Spunge is processed from a specific mineral that is 100% naturally occurring and is completely non-toxic. Apart from its desiccating properties, whereby it absorbs moisture in confined areas prone to damp, it also has cation absorption properties, allowing it to absorb rather than mask odours. This ensures that odours are eliminated for good. Extensive testing by Pratleyâ€™s world-class research and development team has proven the application of Gunge Spunge in arduous operating environments such as mines. Gunge Spunge is supplied in 12 kg bags, although special arrangements can be made for the larger quantities required by the mining industry in particular.
