It incorporates the SmartConcept system, which consists of three features: SmartPowe, SmartDesig and SmartRemote. SmartPower senses when the power supply is poor or faulty then compensates before damage to components occurs, allowing mining operations to use the machine with generators or unreliable power sources. SmartDesign extends machine life and provides unprecedented ease of maintenance, even in extreme environments. This feature includes 70% fewer cables, hardened components, LED headlights and easily accessible grease points and hydraulic hoses. An ergonomic remote control, the SmartRemote, incorporates adjustable straps, intuitive controls and professional-grade radio technology with a 984-foot (300-meter) working range. The Brokk 200 is capable of carrying heavy tools, such as breakers, rock drills, buckets and shotcrete attachments. It’s ideal for heavy duty, difficult-to-access projects and applications.
