Lucara Diamond Corp. has announced that it has entered an agreement with Louis Vuitton company, for the purpose of collaborating on the planning, cutting and polishing of the exceptional, 549 carat white gem diamond referred to as “Sethunya” meaning “Flower” in Setswana. Sethunya was recovered unbroken from direct milling of ore sourced from the EM/PK(S) unit of the South Lobe of Lucara’s 100% owned Karowe Mine in February 2020. This agreement builds on the collaboration, announced in January, with Louis Vuitton and HB on the historic 1,758 carat Sewelô, Botswana’s largest diamond, recovered from Karowe last year
