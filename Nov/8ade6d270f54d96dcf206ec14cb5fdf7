Eurasian Resources Group has announced that Metalkol RTR, its hydro-metallurgical copper and cobalt facility in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), has committed to undergoing the Responsible Minerals Assurance Process (RMAP), a flagship programme of the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI). Metalkol RTR has made a formal commitment to proceed with the RMAP assessment and submitted all required pre-assessment documentation. The aim of the RMAP is to help companies and organisations make informed choices about responsibly sourced minerals in their supply chains.

The assessment employs a risk-based approach to validate smelters’ company-level management processes for responsible mineral procurement.

Benedikt Sobotka, CEO of Eurasian Resources Group and Co-Chair of the Global Battery Alliance, comments, “Cobalt’s role in the world economy is only set to increase as it is a key ingredient in lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles and energy storage which will power the green recovery. “It is vital that the cobalt in these products is sourced responsibly and sustainably, and we have committed to this through our Clean Cobalt Framework, the Cobalt Industry Responsible Assessment Framework and the RMAP.”
