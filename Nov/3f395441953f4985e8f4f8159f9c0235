Bushveld Minerals has satisfied the conditions required to drawdown the US$30 million under the Production Financing Agreement (PFA) and the unsecured Convertible Loan Notes of US$35 million, to be subscribed by Orion Mine Finance first announced on 30 September 2020. The Company is in the process of drawing down funds under the PFA and has given notice to Orion to draw-down on the full amount of US$35 million under the Notes.

On each of the first three loan anniversaries, Bushveld has the option to repay up to 50% of both constituent loan parts (each may only be repaid once). If Bushveld utilises the loan repayment option, the gross revenue rate and / or the unit rate will reduce accordingly. The Company will raise a total of US$35 million through the issue of the Notes pursuant to the related Convertible Loan Instrument (the Instrument).

The Notes are convertible by the holder into Bushveld ordinary shares of 1 pence each in the Company at a price equal to 17 pence. Between issue and the Maturity Date, Orion may, at their option, convert an amount of the outstanding Notes, including capitalised and accrued interest, into Bushveld ordinary shares as follows:
