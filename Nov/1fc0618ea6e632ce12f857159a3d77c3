Katoro Gold has announced an update on its Blyvoor Gold Tailings Project. All technical work related to the upgrade and restatement of the Blyvoor Project resource statement has now been completed, with specific reference to the resource and geotechnical drill programme. Louis Coetzee, Chairman of Katoro Gold comments: “I am pleased about the positive operational progress at Blyvoor where we remain on course regarding the key project objectives as we target early gold production generating considerable revenues for Katoro and our partners. “Blyvoor is a substantial opportunity for Katoro and with each step in our work completed our excitement rises, particularly as we now approach completion of the technical work.  I look forward to providing further updates to the market in the future.” A total of c.1,500 samples was produced from the now completed resource drill programme and submitted for assay analysis. These assay results have now all been received back from the laboratory. The assay results in conjunction with the confirmatory metallurgical test results and geotechnical results are now being interpreted and integrated into the various key technical reports referred to in the RNS of 30 September 2020. The final reports, with an updated Resource and Reserve statement and SAMVAL valuation report, are expected to be received by the Company during November 2020.
