However, with an ever-changing mining code, insufficient infrastructure, political instability and the recent impact of the global health crisis of COVID-19, it can be a challenging destination in which to do business.

This will be highlighted by key influencers, sector specialist and the most successful players who have done business in the DRC mining market sharing their journey towards a profitable business in the DRC, unpacking the hurdles on the way and their strategy to penetrate the market and become prosperous stakeholders in the country and Copperbelt region.
