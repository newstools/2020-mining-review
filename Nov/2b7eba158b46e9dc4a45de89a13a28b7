Did you know that Africa received less than one third of the global $3 billion exploration investment in 2019? This surprising statistic was pointed out by Hubert Danso, CEO and vice-chairman of Africa Investor who was speaking at the keynote session of the inaugural Africa Mining Forum digital event, which is taking place from 16-20 November. The figure is surprising considering the continent’s rich mineral wealth. This includes 90% of the world’s platinum and cobalt supply, 50% of the world’s gold supply and 35% of uranium. Also, it must be noted that less than 50% of continent has been geologically surveyed. So how does Africa realise its true potential particularly at a time of unprecedented disruption in mining operations? According to Danso, the COVID-19 pandemic offers a unique opportunity to try different approaches and public-private partnership models to attract mining investment in Africa. It is for this reason that the Africa Mining Forum is so important. Bringing together the who’s who of the continent’s mining experts, the various sessions provide the ideal platform to identify both the challenges and the opportunities that exist in Africa. The event sets that stage for mining in the ‘new normal’. Among others, the event features one-on-one sessions, a women in mining session and a ministerial forum.
