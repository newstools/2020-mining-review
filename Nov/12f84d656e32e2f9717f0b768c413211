The Tshiamiso Trust would like to issue a warning to people about the actions of dishonest individuals trying fraudulently to trick them into paying over money to assist them with claims for silicosis and TB benefits from the Trust. The Tshiamiso Trust was established in February 2020 to administer the silicosis and TB class action settlement reached between claimantsâ€™ attorneys and six mining companies.

The claims system is not open yet, so no claims can yet be made, but when it is the Trust will communicate and claims will only be made with a Tshiamiso Trust Claims Lodgement Officer. There are different methods being used by the fraudsters. Some are telling people to go to Johannesburg to sign papers, and they charge them fees for transport to Johannesburg. Other methods are used also. The Trust is reporting these people to the SAPS. The Trust is appealing to people wanting to claim to please be careful of dishonest people promising that that they can claim compensation for them. To claim compensation from the Tshiamiso Trust will be free. No one will need to pay anyone for help.
