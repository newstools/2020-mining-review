Wärtsilä and B2Gold will describe how there is no compromise for mining microgrids–reduce operational costs and go green. Project partners B2Gold and Wärtsilä, respectively the owner and the ESS provider and integrator, will provide insights about this exciting first of its kind project in Africa. The session will first detail B2Gold’s rationale for hybridisation, including the key drivers, project structure and a competitive tender process. Then, the full process from tender to optimised solution delivery will be described, including the challenges and benefits of the project’s design and hybrid plant integration to meet the targets originally set by B2Gold.
