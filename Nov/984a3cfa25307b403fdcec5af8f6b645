The Minerals Council South Africa has marked the start of the 16 Days of Activism for No Violence against Women and Children Campaign by remembering the 21,083 South Africans, and especially the 197 mineworkers who have succumbed to COVID-19, and the women in our country who have died at the hands of gender-based violence. We mourn their death and grieve with their loved ones reads a statement issued by the council. “We support President Ramaphosa’s call to the nation to declare gender-based violence as the second pandemic we are currently facing in South Africa, and reiterate the Minerals Council’s commitment to creating awareness of gender-based violence, and to supporting the women in our industry at work and at home so that they may not live in fear.
