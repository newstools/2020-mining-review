Their efforts and perseverance have ensured that today these women can share the labor market and business with their male peers. Moreover, the fact remains that these women are facing challenges such as access to finance, and equipment, which hinders the expansion of their various activities. Join DRC Mining Week for a webinar that will explore how government and financial institutions can help support women that are playing an active role in the DRC’s mining sector.
